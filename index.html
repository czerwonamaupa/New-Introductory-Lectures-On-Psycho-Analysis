<h1>Pre­face</h1>
<p><span class="smallcaps">My</span> <em>Intro­duct­ory Lec­tures on Psycho-Ana­lysis</em> were delivered in the two winter terms of 1915-16 and 1916-17 in one of the lec­ture-rooms of the Vienna Psy­chi­at­rical Clinic, before an audi­ence com­posed of mem­bers and stu­dents of every Fac­ulty. The first half of the lec­tures were impro­vised, and writ­ten down imme­di­ately after­wards; the second half were com­posed during an inter­ven­ing summer vaca­tion in Salzburg, and were delivered word for word in the fol­low­ing winter. In those days I still pos­sessed the gift of a phono­graphic memory.</p>
<p>In con­tra­dis­tinc­tion to them, these new lec­tures have never been delivered. My age has in the mean­time relieved me of the duty of mark­ing my mem­ber­ship of the Uni­ver­sity—even though the rela­tion is only a peri­pheral one—by giving lec­tures; and a sur­gical oper­a­tion has rendered me incap­able of address­ing an audi­ence. It is there­fore only in ima­gin­a­tion that I pic­ture myself once more in the lec­ture-room as I write out what fol­lows; it may help me not to forget my duty to the reader as I delve deeper into my sub­ject.</p>
<p>The new lec­tures are in no way inten­ded to take the place of the earlier ones. They do not com­pose an inde­pend­ent whole which could hope to find a circle of read­ers of its own; but they are con­tinu­ations and sup­ple­ments which fall into three groups in their rela­tion to the earlier lec­tures. To the first group belong the new manip­u­la­tions of themes which have already been dealt with fif­teen years ago, but which demand fur­ther treat­ment on account of the deep­en­ing of our know­ledge, and the alter­a­tion of our views; this group con­sists, that is to say, of crit­ical revi­sions. The two other groups con­tain actual enlarge­ments of our field, in that they deal with mat­ters which either did not exist in psycho-ana­lysis at the time of the first lec­tures, or about which too little was known at that time to jus­tify a spe­cial chapter-head­ing. It cannot be avoided, but it is also not to be deplored, that some of the new lec­tures unite the char­ac­ter­ist­ics of these groups.</p>
<p>I have, moreover, emphas­ized the depend­ence of these new lec­tures on the Intro­duct­ory Lec­tures by num­ber­ing them in con­tinu­ation of the old ones. Thus the first lec­ture in this book is called the Twenty-ninth. Once more, they offer to the ana­lytic spe­cial­ist little that is new, and they are addressed to that large group of edu­cated per­sons to whom, let us hope, one can ascribe a bene­vol­ent, if cau­tious, interest in the spe­cial nature and dis­cov­er­ies of this young sci­ence. And this time again it has been my guid­ing pur­pose to make no sac­ri­fice in favour of appar­ent sim­pli­city, com­plete­ness and final­ity; not to hide any prob­lems and not to deny the exist­ence of gaps and uncer­tain­ties. In no other field of sci­entific work would it be neces­sary to insist upon the mod­esty of one’s claims. In every other sub­ject this is taken for gran­ted; the public expect noth­ing else. No reader of a work on astro­nomy would feel dis­ap­poin­ted and con­temp­tu­ous of that sci­ence, if he were shown the point at which our know­ledge of the uni­verse melts into obscur­ity. Only in psy­cho­logy is it oth­er­wise; here the con­sti­tu­tional inca­pa­city of men for sci­entific research comes into full view. It looks as though people did not expect from psy­cho­logy pro­gress in know­ledge, but some other kind of sat­is­fac­tion; every unsolved prob­lem, every acknow­ledged uncer­tainty is turned into a ground of com­plaint against it.</p>
<p>Any one who loves the sci­ence of the mind must accept these hard­ships as well.</p>

<h2>Revi­sion Of The Theory Of Dreams, Lec­ture XXIX</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—After a silence of more than fif­teen years, I have brought you together again in order to dis­cuss with you the new devel­op­ments, or it may be improve­ments, which have taken place in psycho-ana­lytic theory during the inter­val. From more than one point of view it is right and proper that we should turn our atten­tion, in the first place, to the theory of dreams. This theory occu­pies a pecu­liar pos­i­tion in the his­tory of psycho-ana­lysis; it marks a turn­ing-point. With the theory of dreams, ana­lysis passed from being a psycho-thera­peutic method to being a psy­cho­logy of the depths of human nature. Ever since then the theory of dreams has remained the most char­ac­ter­istic and the most pecu­liar fea­ture of the young sci­ence, some­thing which has no par­al­lel in the rest of sci­entific know­ledge, a new found land, which has been reclaimed from the regions of Folk­lore and Mys­ti­cism. The strange­ness of the ideas which are neces­sar­ily involved in it has made it into a shib­boleth, the use of which dis­tin­guishes those who might become believ­ers in psycho-ana­lysis from those who are incap­able of com­pre­hend­ing it. Speak­ing for myself, I always found it a thing I could hold on to during those dif­fi­cult times when the unsolved prob­lems of the neur­oses used to con­fuse my inex­per­i­enced judg­ment. Whenever I began to have doubts about the cor­rect­ness of my tent­at­ive con­clu­sions, the moment I man­aged to trans­late a sense­less and com­plic­ated dream into a clear and intel­li­gible mental pro­cess in the dreamer, I felt, with renewed con­fid­ence, that I was on the right track.</p>
<p>It is there­fore of espe­cial interest for us to follow, in regard to this par­tic­u­lar matter of the theory of dreams, what changes psycho-ana­lysis has under­gone during the inter­val I have men­tioned, and what pro­gress it has made in gain­ing appre­ci­ation and under­stand­ing from con­tem­por­ary thought. I may as well tell you straight away that you will be dis­ap­poin­ted in both dir­ec­tions.</p>
<p>Let us look through the volumes of the <em>Inter­na­tionale Zeits­chrift für (ärzt­liche) Psy­cho­ana­lyse</em>, in which the most import­ant work on our sub­ject has appeared since 1913. In the earlier volumes you will find one recur­ring head­ing, ‘On the Inter­pret­a­tion of Dreams,’ under which will be a quant­ity of con­tri­bu­tions on vari­ous points of dream-theory. But the fur­ther you go, the rarer such con­tri­bu­tions become; this stand­ing head­ing even­tu­ally dis­ap­pears entirely. The ana­lysts behave as though they had noth­ing more to say about the dream, as though the whole sub­ject of dream-theory were fin­ished and done with. If, on the other hand, you ask how much of the theory of dreams is accep­ted by out­siders, the numer­ous psy­chi­at­rists and psycho-thera­peut­ists, who warm their pot of soup at our fire—without indeed being very grate­ful for our hos­pit­al­ity—the so-called edu­cated people who are in the habit of appro­pri­at­ing the more start­ling of the con­clu­sions of sci­ence, the liter­ati and the gen­eral public, then the answer is not very sat­is­fact­ory. A few for­mu­lae are gen­er­ally known, and, among them, sev­eral which we have never put for­ward, such as the state­ment that all dreams are of a sexual nature; but even such import­ant things as the fun­da­mental dis­tinc­tion between the mani­fest dream-con­tent and the latent dream-thoughts, the view that anxi­ety dreams do not con­tra­dict the wish-ful­filling func­tion of the dream, the impossib­il­ity of inter­pret­ing a dream unless one knows the rel­ev­ant asso­ci­ations of the dreamer, and, above all, the recog­ni­tion of the fact that the most import­ant part of the dream is the dream-work, seem, every one of them, to be as far removed from the con­scious­ness of the gen­er­al­ity of man­kind as they were thirty years ago. I myself have every reason to say this, because during that period I have received an enorm­ous number of let­ters, in which the writers inscribe their dreams for inter­pret­a­tion, or ask for inform­a­tion about the nature of dreams. They declare that they have read the <em>Inter­pret­a­tion of Dreams</em>, and yet in every sen­tence they betray their lack of under­stand­ing of our dream-theory. That will not pre­vent our once more giving an account of what we know about dreams. You will remem­ber that last time we devoted a whole group of lec­tures to show­ing how we have come to under­stand this hitherto unex­plained psychic phe­nomenon.</p>
<p>Sup­pos­ing some one, say a patient under ana­lysis, tells us one of his dreams; then we assume that he has made one of those com­mu­nic­a­tions to us, to which he com­mit­ted him­self when he entered on his ana­lyt­ical treat­ment. It is, of course, a com­mu­nic­a­tion which is insuf­fi­ciently com­mu­nic­at­ive, because a dream is, in itself, not a social utter­ance; it is not a means for making one­self under­stood. We have not, indeed, the least idea what the dreamer wishes to say, and he him­self knows no better than ourselves. At the outset we have to make a quick decision. On the one hand, the dream may be, as the non-ana­lyt­ical phys­i­cians assure us, an indic­a­tion that the dreamer has slept badly, that not all the parts of his brain achieved a uni­form state of rest, that cer­tain regions of it endeav­oured to go on work­ing under the influ­ence of unknown stim­uli and could only do so in a very incom­plete way. If that is the case then we are quite right not to bother ourselves any longer over this psy­cho­lo­gic­ally worth­less product of noc­turnal dis­turb­ance. For how could we expect from the invest­ig­a­tion of such things to arrive at any­thing useful for our pur­poses? On the other hand, how­ever—but it is clear that from the outset we have decided oth­er­wise. We have—per­haps quite arbit­rar­ily—made the assump­tion, put for­ward the pos­tu­late, that even this unin­tel­li­gible dream must be a per­fectly valid, sens­ible and valu­able psychic act, of which we can make use in the ana­lysis, just like any other com­mu­nic­a­tion. Only the result of our attempt can show us whether we are right. If we are able to turn the dream into a valu­able utter­ance of this kind, then we obvi­ously have a chance of learn­ing some­thing new, and of obtain­ing inform­a­tion of such a sort as oth­er­wise would remain inac­cess­ible to us.</p>
<p>Now, how­ever, the dif­fi­culties of our task, and the puzz­ling nature of our theme become appar­ent. How are we going to set about turn­ing a dream into a normal com­mu­nic­a­tion, and how are we going to explain that a part of the utter­ance of our patient has taken on a form which is as unin­tel­li­gible for him as for us?</p>
<p>You will observe, ladies and gen­tle­men, that this time I am not expound­ing the sub­ject on genetic lines, but I am speak­ing dog­mat­ic­ally. The first thing we have to do is to lay the found­a­tions of our new atti­tude towards the prob­lem of the dream by intro­du­cing two new con­cepts and two new names. We call what one usu­ally refers to as the dream, the dream-text or the <em>mani­fest</em> dream, and what we are look­ing for, what we, as it were, sus­pect to lie behind the dream, the <em>latent</em> dream-thoughts. Now we can express our two prob­lems in the fol­low­ing way: we have got to turn the mani­fest dream into the latent dream, and we have to show how the latter became the former in the mental life of the dreamer. The first bit is a prac­tical prob­lem, it comes under the head­ing of <em>dream-inter­pret­a­tion</em>, and requires a tech­nique; the second is a the­or­et­ical prob­lem, its solu­tion should be the explan­a­tion of the hypo­thet­ical <em>dream-work</em>, and can only be a theory. Both the tech­nique of dream-inter­pret­a­tion and the theory of the dream-work have to be built up from the begin­ning.</p>
<p>Which bit shall we begin with? I think we should start with the tech­nique of dream-inter­pret­a­tion. It has a clearer out­line and will make a more vivid impres­sion on you.</p>
<p>The patient, then, has described a dream which we have to inter­pret. We have listened quietly without making use of our powers of reflec­tion. What do we do next? We determ­ine to bother our heads as little as pos­sible over what we have heard—over the <em>mani­fest</em> dream, that is to say. Nat­ur­ally this mani­fest dream dis­plays all sorts of char­ac­ter­ist­ics to which we are not com­pletely indif­fer­ent. It may be coher­ent, smoothly com­posed, like a lit­er­ary work, or unin­tel­li­gibly con­fused, almost like a deli­rium; it may have absurd ele­ments, or jokes and appar­ently bril­liant infer­ences; it may seem clear and well defined to the dreamer, or it may be dim and indef­in­ite; the pic­tures in it may have the full sen­su­ous force of a per­cep­tion, or they may be as shad­owy and vague as a mist. The greatest vari­ety of char­ac­ter­ist­ics can be found dis­trib­uted in the vari­ous parts of the same dream. Finally the dream may be atten­ded by an indif­fer­ent feel­ing tone, or by a very strong pleas­ur­able or pain­ful affect. You must not think that we regard this end­less vari­ety as a matter of no import­ance; we shall come back to it later, and shall find in it much that is useful for our inter­pret­a­tion; but for the present we must put it aside, and travel along the main road which leads to the inter­pret­a­tion of the dream. This means that we ask the dreamer as well to free him­self from the impres­sion of the mani­fest dream, to switch his atten­tion from the dream as a whole to indi­vidual parts of its con­tent, and to tell us one after another the things that occur to him in con­nec­tion with these parts, what asso­ci­ations come into his mind when he turns his mental eye on to each of them sep­ar­ately.</p>
<p>That is a curi­ous tech­nique, is it not? It is not the usual way to treat a com­mu­nic­a­tion or an utter­ance. You guess, of course, that behind this pro­ced­ure there lie con­cealed assump­tions which have not yet been men­tioned. But let us pro­ceed. In what order shall we get the patient to take the parts of his dream? Here we have a vari­ety of courses open to us. We can simply follow the chro­no­lo­gical order in which the dream has been presen­ted to us in descrip­tion. That is what one might call the strict­est, the clas­sical method. Or we can ask the dreamer to look for the <em>residue of the pre­vi­ous day</em> in his dream, because exper­i­ence has taught us that in almost every dream is incor­por­ated a memory trace of, or an allu­sion to, an event (or it may be sev­eral events) of the pre­vi­ous day; and if we follow up these links we often dis­cover all of a sudden the bridge from the appar­ently remote dream-world to the real life of the patient. Or else we tell him to begin with those ele­ments in the dream-con­tent which have struck him on account of their clar­ity and sen­su­ous force. We happen to know that it is par­tic­u­larly easy for him to obtain asso­ci­ations to such ele­ments. It makes no dif­fer­ence by which of these ways we choose to reach the asso­ci­ations we are look­ing for.</p>
<p>And now let us con­sider these asso­ci­ations. They con­sist of the most varied mater­ial, memor­ies of the day before, the ‘dream day,’ and memor­ies of times long since passed, delib­er­a­tions, argu­ments for and against, admis­sions and ques­tion­ings. A great many of them are poured out by the patient with ease, while he hes­it­ates when he reaches others. Most of them show a clear con­nec­tion with one of the ele­ments of the dream, and no wonder, because they have actu­ally sprung from these ele­ments; but it may also happen that the patient intro­duces them with the words: ‘That doesn’t seem to have any­thing to do with the dream at all; I say it because it comes into my head.’</p>
<p>When one listens to this flood of ideas, one soon notices that they have more in common with the con­tent of the dream than the mere fact that it provided them with their origin. They throw an aston­ish­ingly clear light on all the parts of the dream, they fill in the gaps between them, and they make their odd jux­ta­pos­i­tion intel­li­gible. Finally, we must get clear the rela­tion between them and the con­tent of the dream. The dream seems to be an abridged extract from the asso­ci­ations, which has been put together in accord­ance with rules which we have not yet con­sidered; its ele­ments are like the rep­res­ent­at­ives of a mul­ti­tude which have been chosen by vote. There is no doubt that our tech­nique has enabled us to dis­cover what the dream has replaced, and wherein lies its psy­cho­lo­gical value; and what we have dis­covered dis­plays no longer the bewil­der­ing pecu­li­ar­it­ies of the dream, its strange­ness and its con­fused nature.</p>
<p>But let us have no mis­un­der­stand­ing. The asso­ci­ations to the dream are not the latent dream-thoughts. These are con­tained, but not com­pletely con­tained, in the asso­ci­ations. On the one hand, the asso­ci­ations pro­duce a great deal more than we require for the for­mu­la­tion of the latent dream-thoughts, namely, all the elab­or­a­tions, the trans­itions and the con­nect­ing links, which the intel­lect of the patient must pro­duce on the road which leads to the dream-thoughts. On the other hand, the asso­ci­ation has often stopped short imme­di­ately before it has reached the dream-thoughts them­selves; it has only touched them allus­ively. We now play a part ourselves: we follow up the indic­a­tions, we draw inev­it­able con­clu­sions and bring out into the open what the patient in his asso­ci­ations has only touched upon. That sounds as if we allow our clev­erness and our arbit­rary ima­gin­a­tion to play with the mater­ial which the dreamer has placed at our dis­posal, and misuse it to the extent of read­ing into his utter­ances what we have no busi­ness to find there; and indeed it is no easy matter to show the pro­pri­ety of our beha­viour in an abstract expos­i­tion. But if you try a dream-ana­lysis yourselves, or make yourselves famil­iar with a well-described example from our lit­er­at­ure, you will be con­vinced of the com­pel­ling manner in which such a pro­cess of inter­pret­a­tion unfolds itself.</p>
<p>Although in dream-inter­pret­a­tion we are in gen­eral and pre­dom­in­antly depend­ent on the asso­ci­ations of the dreamer, nev­er­the­less we treat cer­tain ele­ments of the con­tent quite inde­pend­ently—mainly because we have to, because, as a rule, asso­ci­ations refuse to come. We noticed at an early stage that this hap­pens always in con­nec­tion with the same mater­ial; these ele­ments are not very numer­ous, and long exper­i­ence has taught us that they are to be taken as <em>sym­bols</em> for some­thing else, and to be inter­preted as such. In com­par­ison with the other ele­ments of the dream one can give them a per­man­ent mean­ing, which need not, how­ever, be ambigu­ous, and the limits of which are determ­ined by spe­cial laws, which are of an unusual kind. Since we under­stand how to trans­late these sym­bols, while the dreamer does not, although he him­self has made use of them, it may very well be that the sense of the dream is imme­di­ately clear to us, even before we have begun the work of dream-inter­pret­a­tion, as soon as we have heard the text of the dream, while the dreamer him­self is still puzzled by it. But in the earlier lec­tures I have already said so much about sym­bol­ism, about our know­ledge of it, and about the spe­cial prob­lems to which it gives rise, that I need not go over the same ground again to-day.</p>
<p>That, then, is our method of dream-inter­pret­a­tion. The next and very proper ques­tion is—can we by these means inter­pret every dream? And the answer is—no, not every one; but so many that we can afford to be abso­lutely cer­tain about the util­ity and cor­rect­ness of our pro­ced­ure. But why not all? The recent answer to this ques­tion will teach us some­thing import­ant, which has a bear­ing on the psy­cho­lo­gical con­di­tions of dream form­a­tion. It is because the work of inter­pret­a­tion is car­ried on in the face of res­ist­ance, which may vary from an imper­cept­ible amount to an amount so great that we cannot over­come it—at any rate with the means which are at present at our dis­posal. One cannot help observing the mani­fest­a­tion of this res­ist­ance during the inter­pret­a­tion. In many places the asso­ci­ations are given without hes­it­a­tion, and the first or second of them already provides us with the explan­a­tion. In other places the patient pauses and hes­it­ates before he utters an asso­ci­ation, and then one often has to listen to a long chain of ideas before one gets any­thing which is of any use for the under­stand­ing of the dream. We are right in sup­pos­ing that the longer and the more cir­cuit­ous the chain of asso­ci­ations, the stronger is the res­ist­ance. And in the for­get­ting of dreams, too, we sense the same influ­ence. Often enough it hap­pens that, how­ever much he may try, the patient cannot remem­ber one of his dreams. But when, by a piece of ana­lyt­ical work, we have removed a dif­fi­culty which has been dis­turb­ing the patient in his rela­tion to the ana­lysis, the for­got­ten dream will come into his mind quite sud­denly. Two more obser­va­tions may be men­tioned here. It very often hap­pens that a piece of the dream is miss­ing, which is even­tu­ally added as an after­thought. This is to be regarded as an attempt to forget that par­tic­u­lar piece. Exper­i­ence shows that it is this very piece of the dream which is the most valu­able; we sup­pose that a stronger res­ist­ance stood in the way of its com­mu­nic­a­tion than was the case with the other parts. And, fur­ther­more, we often find that a patient may try to combat the for­get­ting of his dreams by writ­ing them down imme­di­ately after he wakes up. We may as well tell him that it is use­less to do so, because the res­ist­ance from which he may have pre­served the text of the dream will then trans­fer itself to the asso­ci­ations and render the mani­fest dream inac­cess­ible for inter­pret­a­tion. This being the case, we need not be sur­prised if a fur­ther increase of the res­ist­ance sup­presses the asso­ci­ations alto­gether, and thus frus­trates the inter­pret­a­tion of the dream entirely.</p>
<p>From all this we draw the con­clu­sion that the res­ist­ance which we come across during the pro­cess of dream-inter­pret­a­tion must play some part in the form­a­tion of the dream as well. One can actu­ally dis­tin­guish between dreams which have been formed under low pres­sure of res­ist­ance and those in which the res­ist­ance has been high. But this pres­sure also changes within the same dream from one place to another; it is respons­ible for the gaps, the obscur­it­ies and the con­fu­sion which may upset the coher­ence of the most beau­ti­ful dreams.</p>
<p>But what is the res­ist­ance doing here, and what is it res­ist­ing? Now for us a res­ist­ance is the sure sign of a con­flict. There must be a force present which is trying to express some­thing, and another which is striv­ing to pre­vent its expres­sion. What comes into being as the mani­fest dream may, there­fore, be regarded as com­pris­ing all the solu­tions to which the battle between these two oppos­ing forces can be reduced. At one point one of the forces may have been able to get through what it wanted to say, at another the coun­ter­act­ing force may have suc­ceeded in abol­ish­ing the inten­ded com­mu­nic­a­tion entirely, or may have sub­sti­tuted for it some­thing which betrays no sign of it. The most usual cases, and those which are the most char­ac­ter­istic of the pro­cess of dream-form­a­tion, are those in which the con­flict res­ults in a com­prom­ise, so that the com­mu­nic­at­ing force can indeed say what it wants to say, but not in the way it wants to say it; it is toned down, dis­tor­ted and made unre­cog­niz­able. If there­fore the dream does not faith­fully rep­res­ent the dream-thoughts, if a pro­cess of inter­pret­a­tion is neces­sary to bridge the gulf between the two, this is the result of the coun­ter­act­ing, inhib­it­ing and restrain­ing force whose exist­ence we have inferred from per­ceiv­ing the res­ist­ance in dream-inter­pret­a­tion. So long as we regarded the dream as an isol­ated phe­nomenon, inde­pend­ent of other psy­cho­lo­gical form­a­tions which are allied to it, we called this force the <em>dream-censor</em>.</p>
<p>You have long been famil­iar with the fact that this cen­sor­ship is not a mech­an­ism which is pecu­liar to dreams. You remem­ber that the con­flict of two psychic factors, which we—roughly—call the repressed uncon­scious and the con­scious, dom­in­ates our lives, and that the res­ist­ance against the inter­pret­a­tion of dreams, the hall-mark of the dream-cen­sor­ship, is none other than the repres­sion-res­ist­ance which keeps these two factors apart. You also know that under cer­tain con­di­tions other psy­cho­lo­gical form­a­tions emerge from the con­flict between these same factors, form­a­tions which are the result of com­prom­ises just as dreams are; and you will not require me to repeat all that is involved in my intro­duc­tion to the theory of the neur­oses in order to put before you what we know about the con­di­tions under which such com­prom­ise form­a­tions come about. You will have real­ized that the dream is a patho­lo­gical product, the first member of the series which includes the hys­ter­ical symp­tom, the obses­sion and the delu­sion among its mem­bers; it is dif­fer­en­ti­ated from the others by its trans­it­or­i­ness and by the fact that it occurs under con­di­tions which are part of normal life. For we must never forget that the dream-life is, as Aris­totle has already told us, the way our mind works during sleep. The state of sleep rep­res­ents a turn­ing away from the real external world, and thus provides a neces­sary con­di­tion for the devel­op­ment of a psy­chosis. The most pen­et­rat­ing study of ser­i­ous cases of psy­chosis will reveal no char­ac­ter­istic which is more typ­ical of these patho­lo­gical con­di­tions. In psychoses, how­ever, the turn­ing away from real­ity is brought about in two ways; either because the repressed uncon­scious is too strong, so that it over­whelms the con­scious which tries to cling on to real­ity, or because real­ity has become so unbear­ably pain­ful that the threatened ego, in a des­pair­ing ges­ture of oppos­i­tion, throws itself into the arms of the uncon­scious impulses. The harm­less dream-psy­chosis is the result of a con­sciously willed, and only tem­por­ary, with­drawal from the external world; it ceases to oper­ate when rela­tions with the external world are resumed. While the sleeper is isol­ated, there is an alter­a­tion in the dis­tri­bu­tion of his psychic energy; part of the repress­ive expendit­ure, which is oth­er­wise used to keep down the uncon­scious, can be saved, for if the uncon­scious makes use of its rel­at­ive free­dom and enters on some activ­ity, it finds the avenue to motor expres­sion stopped up, and only the inno­cent outlet of hal­lu­cin­at­ory sat­is­fac­tion open to it. It can now, there­fore, form a dream, but the fact of dream-cen­sor­ship shows that enough repress­ive res­ist­ance remains oper­at­ive even during sleep.</p>
<p>Here we have an oppor­tun­ity of answer­ing the ques­tion whether the dream has also a func­tion to per­form, whether any useful task is entrus­ted to it. The con­di­tion of repose without stim­uli, which the state of sleep attempts to bring about, is threatened from three sides: in a chance fash­ion by external stim­uli during sleep, by interests of the day before which have not yet abated and, in an unavoid­able manner, by the unsat­is­fied repressed impulses, which are ready to seize on any oppor­tun­ity for expres­sion. On account of the nightly reduc­tion of the repress­ive forces, the risk is run that the repose of sleep will be broken every time the outer and inner dis­turb­ances manage to link up with one of the uncon­scious sources of energy. The dream-pro­cess allows the result of such a com­bin­a­tion to dis­charge itself through the chan­nel of a harm­less hal­lu­cin­at­ory exper­i­ence, and thus insures the con­tinu­ity of sleep. There is no con­tra­dic­tion of this func­tion in the fact that the dream some­times wakes the sleeper in a state of anxi­ety; it is rather a sign that the watcher regards the situ­ation as being too dan­ger­ous, and no longer thinks he can cope with it. Quite often, indeed, while we are still asleep, we are aware of the com­fort­ing thought, which is there to pre­vent our waking up: ‘after all, it is only a dream.’</p>
<p>That is all, ladies and gen­tle­men, that I wanted to say about dream-inter­pret­a­tion, the busi­ness of which is to trace the mani­fest dream back to the latent dream-thoughts. When this has been done, the interest in the dream from the point of view of prac­tical ana­lysis fades. The ana­lyst links up the com­mu­nic­a­tion which he has received in the form of a dream with the patient’s other com­mu­nic­a­tions and pro­ceeds with the ana­lysis. We, how­ever, wish to linger a little longer over the dream; we are temp­ted to study the pro­cess by means of which the latent dream-thoughts are trans­formed into the mani­fest dream. We call this the dream-work. You will remem­ber that in the pre­vi­ous lec­tures I described it in such detail that, for to-day’s review of the sub­ject, I can con­fine myself to the briefest sum­mary.</p>
<p>The pro­cess of dream-work is some­thing quite new and strange, the like of which has never before been known. It has given us our first glimpse into those pro­cesses which go on in our uncon­scious mental system, and shows us that they are quite dif­fer­ent from what we know about our con­scious thought, and that to this latter they must neces­sar­ily appear faulty and pre­pos­ter­ous. The import­ance of this dis­cov­ery is increased when we real­ise that the same mech­an­isms—we hardly dare call them ‘thought pro­cesses’—are at work in the form­a­tion of neur­otic symp­toms as have turned the latent dream-thoughts into the mani­fest dream.</p>
<p>In what fol­lows I cannot avoid making my expos­i­tion a schem­atic one. Sup­pos­ing we have before us in a given instance all the latent thoughts, more or less affect­ively toned, which have taken the place of the mani­fest dream after a com­plete inter­pret­a­tion. We shall then notice a dis­tinc­tion among them, and this dis­tinc­tion will take us a long way. Almost all these dream-thoughts will be recog­nised or acknow­ledged by the dreamer; he will admit that he thought thus at one time or another, or that he might very well have done so. But he may resist the accept­a­tion of one single thought, it is for­eign to him, per­haps even repel­lent; it may be that he will pas­sion­ately repu­di­ate it. Now it becomes clear to us that the other thoughts are bits of his con­scious, or, more cor­rectly, of his pre-con­scious thought; they might very well have been thought during waking life, and have prob­ably formed them­selves during the day. This one rejec­ted thought, or, better, this one impulse, is a child of the night; it belongs to the uncon­scious of the dreamer, and is there­fore dis­owned and repu­di­ated by him. It had to await the nightly relax­a­tion of repres­sion in order to achieve any sort of expres­sion. In any case the expres­sion that it obtains is enfeebled, dis­tor­ted and dis­guised; without the work of inter­pret­a­tion we should never have dis­covered it. It is thanks to its con­nec­tion with the other unob­jec­tion­able dream-thoughts that this uncon­scious impulse has had the oppor­tun­ity of slip­ping past the bar­rier of the cen­sor­ship in an unos­ten­ta­tious dis­guise; on the other hand, the pre-con­scious dream-thoughts owe to the same con­nec­tion their power of occupy­ing the mental life, even during sleep. We can, indeed, have no doubt about this: the uncon­scious impulse is the real cre­ator of the dream, it provides the psychic energy required for its form­a­tion. Just like any other instinctual impulse it can do no other than seek its own sat­is­fac­tion, and our exper­i­ence in dream-inter­pret­a­tion shows us, moreover, that this is the mean­ing of all dream­ing. In every dream an instinctual wish is dis­played as ful­filled. The nightly cut­ting-off of mental life from real­ity, and the regres­sion to prim­it­ive mech­an­isms which it makes pos­sible, enable this desired instinctual sat­is­fac­tion to be exper­i­enced in a hal­lu­cin­at­ory fash­ion as actu­ally hap­pen­ing. On account of the same pro­cess of regres­sion ideas are turned into visual pic­tures in the dream; the latent dream-thoughts are, that is to say, dram­at­ized and illus­trated.</p>
<p>From this piece of dream-work we obtain inform­a­tion about some of the most strik­ing and pecu­liar char­ac­ter­ist­ics of the dream. Let me repeat the stages of dream-form­a­tion. The intro­duc­tion: the wish to sleep, the vol­un­tary with­drawal from the out­side world. Two things follow from this: firstly, the pos­sib­il­ity for older and more prim­it­ive modes of activ­ity to mani­fest them­selves, <em>i.e</em>. regres­sion; and secondly, the decrease of the repres­sion-res­ist­ance which weighs on the uncon­scious. As a result of this latter fea­ture an oppor­tun­ity for dream-form­a­tion presents itself, which is seized upon by the factors which are the occa­sion of the dream; that is to say, the internal and external stim­uli which are in activ­ity. The dream which thus even­tu­ates is already a com­prom­ise-form­a­tion; it has a double func­tion: it is on the one hand in con­form­ity with the ego (‘ego­syn­tonic’), since it sub­serves the wish to sleep by drain­ing off the stim­uli which would oth­er­wise dis­turb it, while on the other hand it allows to a repressed impulse the sat­is­fac­tion which is pos­sible in these cir­cum­stances in the form of an hal­lu­cin­at­ory wish-ful­fil­ment. The whole pro­cess of dream-form­a­tion, which is per­mit­ted by the sleep­ing ego, is, how­ever, under the con­trol of the cen­sor­ship, a con­trol which is exer­cised by what is left of the forces of repres­sion. I cannot explain the pro­cess more simply; it is not in itself sim­pler than that. But now I can pro­ceed with the descrip­tion of the dream-work.</p>
<p>Let us go back once more to the latent dream-thoughts. Their dom­in­at­ing ele­ment is the repressed impulse, which has obtained some kind of expres­sion, toned down and dis­guised though it may be, by asso­ci­at­ing itself with stim­uli which happen to be there and by tack­ing itself on the residue of the day before. Just like any other impulse this one presses for­ward toward sat­is­fac­tion in action, but the path to motor dis­charge is closed to it on account of the physiolo­gical char­ac­ter­ist­ics of the state of sleep, and so it is forced to travel in the ret­ro­grade dir­ec­tion to per­cep­tion, and con­tent itself with an hal­lu­cin­at­ory sat­is­fac­tion. The latent dream-thoughts are there­fore turned into a col­lec­tion of sens­ory images and visual scenes. As they are trav­el­ling in this dir­ec­tion some­thing hap­pens to them which seems to us new and bewil­der­ing. All the verbal appar­atus by means of which the more subtle thought-rela­tions are expressed, the con­junc­tions and pre­pos­i­tions, the vari­ations of declen­sion and con­jug­a­tion, are lack­ing, because the means of por­tray­ing them are absent: just as in prim­it­ive, gram­mar­less speech, only the raw mater­ial of thought can be expressed, and the abstract is merged again in the con­crete from which it sprang. What is left over may very well seem to lack coher­ence. It is as much the result of the archaic regres­sion in the mental appar­atus as of the demands of the cen­sor­ship that so much use is made of the rep­res­ent­a­tion of cer­tain objects and pro­cesses by means of sym­bols which have become strange to con­scious thought. But of more far-reach­ing import are the other alter­a­tions to which the ele­ments com­pris­ing the dream-thoughts are sub­jec­ted. Such of them as have any point of con­tact are <em>con­densed</em> into new unit­ies. When the thoughts are trans­lated into pic­tures those forms are indubit­ably pre­ferred which allow of this kind of tele­scop­ing, or con­dens­a­tion; it is as though a force were at work which sub­jec­ted the mater­ial to a pro­cess of pres­sure or squeez­ing together. As a result of con­dens­a­tion one ele­ment in a mani­fest dream may cor­res­pond to a number of ele­ments of the dream-thoughts; but con­versely one of the ele­ments from among the dream-thoughts may be rep­res­en­ted by a number of pic­tures in the dream.</p>
<p>Even more remark­able is the other pro­cess of <em>dis­place­ment</em> or trans­fer­ence of accent, which in con­scious think­ing fig­ures only as an error in thought or as a method employed in jokes. For the indi­vidual ideas which make up the dream-thoughts are not all of equal value; they have vari­ous degrees of affect­ive-tone attached to them, and cor­res­pond­ing to these, they are judged as more or less import­ant, and more or less worthy of atten­tion. In the dream-work these ideas are sep­ar­ated from their affects; the affects are treated sep­ar­ately. They may be trans­ferred to some­thing else, they may remain where they were, they may undergo trans­form­a­tion, or they may dis­ap­pear from the dream entirely. The import­ance of the ideas which have been shorn of their affect, reappears in the dream in the form of the sen­su­ous vivid­ness of the dream-pic­tures; but we notice that this accent, which should lie on import­ant ele­ments, has been trans­ferred to unim­port­ant ones, so that what seems to be pushed to the fore­front in the dream, as the most import­ant ele­ment in it, only plays a sub­si­di­ary role in the dream-thoughts, and con­versely, what is import­ant among the dream-thoughts obtains only incid­ental and rather indis­tinct rep­res­ent­a­tion in the dream. No other factor in the dream-work plays such an import­ant part in ren­der­ing the dream strange and unin­tel­li­gible to the dreamer. Dis­place­ment is the chief method employed in the pro­cess of <em>dream-dis­tor­tion</em>, which the dream-thoughts have to undergo under the influ­ence of the cen­sor­ship.</p>
<p>After these oper­a­tions on the dream-thoughts the dream is almost ready. There is still, how­ever, a more or less non-con­stant factor, the so-called sec­ond­ary elab­or­a­tion, that makes its appear­ance after the dream has come into con­scious­ness as an object of per­cep­tion. When the dream has come into con­scious­ness, we treat it in exactly the same way that we treat any con­tent of per­cep­tion; we try to fill in the gaps, we add con­nect­ing links, and often enough we let ourselves in for ser­i­ous mis­un­der­stand­ings. But this, as it were, ration­al­iz­ing activ­ity, which at its best provides the dream with a smooth façade, such as cannot cor­res­pond to its real con­tent, may be alto­gether absent in some cases, or only oper­ate in a very feeble way, in which case the dream dis­plays to view all its gaps and incon­sist­en­cies. On the other hand, one must not forget that the dream-work too does not always func­tion with equal force; quite often it limits its activ­ity to cer­tain parts of the dream-thoughts, while others are allowed to come into the dream unaltered. In this event one has the impres­sion that one has car­ried out the most com­plic­ated and subtle intel­lec­tual oper­a­tions during the dream, that one has made bril­liant spec­u­la­tions or jokes, or that one has come to decisions or solved prob­lems; really, how­ever, all this is the result of our normal mental activ­ity, and may just as well have happened during the day before the dream as during the night. It has noth­ing to do with the dream-work, nor does it dis­play any fea­ture which is char­ac­ter­istic of dreams. It is per­haps not super­flu­ous once more to emphas­ise the dis­tinc­tion which sub­sists among the dream-thoughts them­selves, between the uncon­scious impulse and the residues of the pre­ced­ing day. While the latter exhibit the whole vari­ety of our mental activ­ity, the former, which is the real motive force of the dream, always finds its outlet in a wish-ful­fil­ment.</p>
<p>I could have told you all that fif­teen years ago; in fact I actu­ally did tell it you at the time. Now let us bring together such modi­fic­a­tions and new dis­cov­er­ies as have been made during the inter­val.</p>
<p>I have already told you that I am afraid you will find that there is very little to say; so you will not under­stand why I have obliged you to listen to the same thing twice over, and have obliged myself to say it. But fif­teen years have passed, and I hoped that in this way I might most easily re-estab­lish con­tact with you. And indeed these ele­ment­ary mat­ters are of such decis­ive import­ance for the under­stand­ing of psycho-ana­lysis, that it is a good thing to hear them for a second time, and the very fact that they have remained the same after fif­teen years is in itself some­thing worth know­ing.</p>
<p>You will nat­ur­ally find in the lit­er­at­ure of these years a great deal of con­firm­at­ory mater­ial and expos­i­tion of details, of which I only intend to give you examples. I can also add to this a cer­tain amount that was already known before. Most of it has to do with sym­bol­ism and the other meth­ods of rep­res­ent­a­tion in dreams. Only quite recently the phys­i­cians at an Amer­ican uni­ver­sity refused to allow that psycho-ana­lysis was a sci­ence, on the ground that it admits of no exper­i­mental proof. They might have raised the same objec­tion against astro­nomy; exper­i­ment­a­tion with the heav­enly bodies is after all exceed­ingly dif­fi­cult. There one has to rely on obser­va­tion. Nev­er­the­less, cer­tain Vien­nese invest­ig­at­ors have made a start on the exper­i­mental con­firm­a­tion of our theory of dream-sym­bol­ism. Dr. Schröt­ter dis­covered as long ago as 1912 that when one orders a deeply hyp­not­ized person to dream of sexual activ­it­ies, the sexual mater­ial in the dream that is thus pro­voked is rep­res­en­ted by the sym­bols which are famil­iar to us. For example, a woman is told to dream of sexual inter­course with a lady friend of hers. In her dream the friend appears with a trav­el­ling-bag, which has a label pasted on it: ‘Ladies only.’ Even more impress­ive are the exper­i­ments of Betl­heim and Hart­mann (1924), who worked with patients suf­fer­ing from the so-called Kor­sakow’s syn­drome. They told the patient stor­ies with a crude sexual con­tent, and then noted the dis­tor­tions which appeared when he was asked to repro­duce what he had heard. Here again the sym­bols with which we are famil­iar as stand­ing for the sexual organs and sexual inter­course cropped up, and among them the symbol of a stair­case, with regard to which the authors very prop­erly observe that it would be inac­cess­ible to a con­scious inten­tion to dis­tort.</p>
<p>Sil­berer per­formed a very inter­est­ing series of exper­i­ments in which he showed that one can sur­prise the dream-work, as it were, <em>in flag­ranti delicto</em>, and see how it trans­lates the abstract thoughts into visual pic­tures. When he tried to force him­self, in a very tired and sleepy con­di­tion, to per­form an intel­lec­tual task, the thought itself would escape him, and in its place would come a visual image, which was often a sub­sti­tute for it.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example. The thought which Sil­berer set before him­self was that he must smooth out an uneven pas­sage in an art­icle. His visual image was that he saw him­self plan­ing a piece of wood. It often happened in these exper­i­ments that it was not the idea which was await­ing elab­or­a­tion that formed the con­tent of the visual image, but his own state of mind while he was trying to make the effort—the sub­ject­ive con­di­tion rather than the object­ive con­tent. This Sil­berer calls a ‘func­tional phe­nomenon.’ An example will easily show you what is meant. The author is trying to make a com­par­ison between the views of two philo­soph­ers about some prob­lem, but in his drowsi­ness one of these views is always escap­ing him, and finally he has a vision of him­self asking inform­a­tion of a cross-grained sec­ret­ary, who is lean­ing over his desk and dis­reg­ards him at first and then looks at him with a dis­agree­able expres­sion, as if he would like to send him about his busi­ness. It is prob­ably due to the con­di­tions of the exper­i­ment itself that the visual images which are aroused in this way so often rep­res­ent intro­spect­ive mater­ial.</p>
<p>Let us con­sider sym­bols a little longer. There were some which we thought we had grasped, but about which we were nev­er­the­less troubled because we could give no account of how that par­tic­u­lar symbol got its par­tic­u­lar mean­ing. In such cases any con­firm­a­tion we could get from other sources, from philo­logy, folk­lore, myth­o­logy or ritual, was par­tic­u­larly wel­come. An example of this kind was the symbol of a cloak. We held that in a woman’s dream a cloak stood for a man. I hope now you will be impressed when you hear that Reik (1920) tells us: ‘In the ancient mar­riage cere­mony of the Bedouins the bride­groom covers the bride with a spe­cial cloak which is called an ‟aba,” and at the same time utters the ritual words: ‟Let no man in the future cover thee but me”’ (from Robert Eisler, <em>Wel­t­en­man­tel und Him­melszelt</em>). We have also dis­covered a great many new sym­bols, of which I will give you two examples. Accord­ing to Abra­ham (1922) a spider in a dream is a symbol of the mother; but it means the phal­lic mother, whom one fears, so that the fear of the spider expresses the horror of incest with the mother and the abhor­rence felt towards the female gen­it­als. You know per­haps that the myth­o­lo­gical figure of the Medusa’s head is to be traced back to the same motif of cas­tra­tion-fear. The other symbol of which I should like to speak is the symbol of the bridge. Fer­enczi has explained it (1921-1922). It stands ori­gin­ally for the male gen­ital organ, which con­nects the par­ents with each other during sexual inter­course; but it devel­ops into a wider set of mean­ings, which spring out of the first. Since the male gen­ital organ is respons­ible for the fact that one can emerge from the waters of birth into the world, the bridge depicts the pas­sage from Yonder (not-yet-born-ness, the womb) to Here (life), and since man­kind also rep­res­ents death as the return into the mother’s womb (into the water), the symbol of the bridge gets the mean­ing of some­thing that brings about death; and finally, fur­ther removed from its ori­ginal mean­ing, it indic­ates trans­ition, or any change of con­di­tion whatever. That is why a woman who has not yet over­come her desire to be a man so fre­quently dreams of bridges which are too short to reach the other side.</p>
<p>Very often pic­tures and situ­ations appear in the mani­fest con­tent of the dream which remind one of well-known themes from fairy stor­ies, legends and myths. The inter­pret­a­tion of such dreams throws light on the ori­ginal motives which cre­ated these themes, though nat­ur­ally we must not forget the change of mean­ing which this mater­ial has under­gone during the pas­sage of time. Our work of inter­pret­a­tion uncov­ers what one might call the raw mater­ial, which often enough may be regarded as sexual in the broad­est sense of the word, but which has found the most varied applic­a­tion in later elab­or­a­tions. When we trace things back like this we very often arouse the rage of all invest­ig­at­ors who do not share the ana­lyt­ical point of view, as though we were seek­ing to deny or under­es­tim­ate all the later devel­op­ments which the raw mater­ial has under­gone. None the less such ways of look­ing at things are instruct­ive and inter­est­ing. The same is true of the tra­cing back of vari­ous motifs of plastic art—as, for example, when J. Eisler (1919), guided by the dreams of his patients, inter­prets ana­lyt­ic­ally the young man play­ing with a little boy, por­trayed in the Hermes of Prax­iteles. Finally, I cannot help men­tion­ing how often myth­o­lo­gical themes find their explan­a­tion through dream-inter­pret­a­tion. The story of the Labyrinth, for example, is found to be a rep­res­ent­a­tion of anal birth; the tor­tu­ous paths are the bowels, and the thread of Ariadne is the umbil­ical cord.</p>
<p>The method of rep­res­ent­a­tion which the dream-work adopts, a fas­cin­at­ing and almost inex­haust­ible sub­ject, is con­stantly becom­ing better known to us as we study it more closely. I will give you a few proofs of this. The notion of fre­quency, for instance, is expressed in dreams by means of the mul­ti­plic­a­tion of sim­il­ars. Listen to this remark­able dream of a young girl. She goes into a hall and finds there a person sit­ting on a chair; this figure is repeated six times, eight times, and even more, but every time the person is her father. This can easily be under­stood when one learns from the addi­tional fea­tures which emerged in inter­pret­a­tion that the room rep­res­ents the womb. The dream then becomes equi­val­ent to the famil­iar fantasy of the young girl who believes that she met her father during her intrauter­ine life, when he vis­ited the womb during her mother’s preg­nancy. The fact that an ele­ment in the dream is turned the wrong way round, that the act of entry is trans­ferred from the father to the dreamer her­self, should not lead you astray; it has indeed a spe­cial mean­ing of its own. The mul­ti­plic­a­tion of the father image can only mean that the pro­ced­ure in ques­tion was fre­quently repeated. But then the dream always turns tem­poral rela­tions into spa­tial ones whenever it has to deal with them. Thus, one may see in a dream a scene between people who look very small and far away, as if one were look­ing at them through the wrong end of a pair of opera glasses. The small­ness and the spa­tial remote­ness here mean the same; it is remote­ness in time that is meant, the inter­pret­a­tion being that it is a scene from the far dis­tant past. Besides this, you may remem­ber that in my pre­vi­ous lec­tures I showed you, with the help of examples, that we had learnt to make use even of the purely formal char­ac­ter­ist­ics of the mani­fest dream for pur­poses of inter­pret­a­tion; that is to say, to turn, them into the con­tent of the latent dream-thoughts. Now you know, of course, that all the dreams of one night belong to the same con­text; but it is by no means imma­ter­ial whether these dreams appear to the dreamer as a con­tinuum, or whether they are organ­ized in sev­eral pieces, and if so in how many. The number of pieces often cor­res­ponds to the same number of dis­tinct nodal points in the chain of thoughts, which make up the latent dream-thoughts; or it may cor­res­pond to forces in the mental life of the dreamer which are strug­gling with one another, and each of which finds its main (though not its exclus­ive) expres­sion in one par­tic­u­lar part of the dream. A short intro­duct­ory dream and a long main dream often stand to each other in the rela­tion of con­di­tion and con­sequent; of this you will find a very clear example in the old lec­tures. A dream which the dreamer describes as ‘some­how inter­pol­ated’ really cor­res­ponds to a depend­ent clause in the dream-thoughts. Franz Alex­an­der in his essay on pairs of dreams shows that not infre­quently two dreams which occur on the same night play sep­ar­ate parts in the ful­fil­ment of the dream-func­tion, so that taken together they provide a wish-ful­fil­ment in two steps, a thing which each alone does not do. If a dream-wish has as its con­tent some piece of for­bid­den beha­viour towards a cer­tain indi­vidual, then that person may appear in the first dream undis­guised while the beha­viour is only faintly indic­ated. In the second dream it will be the other way round. The beha­viour will be openly shown, but the person will be made unre­cog­niz­able, or else some indif­fer­ent person will be sub­sti­tuted for him. It must be admit­ted that this gives one an impres­sion of delib­er­ate art­ful­ness. A second and sim­ilar rela­tion between two mem­bers of a pair of dreams is that in which the one rep­res­ents the pun­ish­ment and the other the sinful wish-ful­fil­ment. It is just as if one said: ‘If I take the pun­ish­ment on myself, then I can do the for­bid­den thing.’</p>
<p>I must not detain you longer with such dis­cov­er­ies of mat­ters of detail, nor with dis­cus­sions of the uses of dream-inter­pret­a­tion in ana­lytic work. I am sure you are impa­tient to hear what alter­a­tions have been made in our basic atti­tude towards the nature and mean­ing of dreams. You will be pre­pared to hear that there is little to tell. The most hotly dis­puted point of the whole theory was undoubtedly the asser­tion that all dreams are wish-ful­fil­ments. The inev­it­able and ever-recur­rent objec­tion from the laity that there are so many anxi­ety-dreams has already been com­pletely answered, I think, in my earlier lec­tures. We have kept our theory intact by divid­ing dreams into wish-dreams, anxi­ety-dreams, and pun­ish­ment-dreams.</p>
<p>Even pun­ish­ment-dreams are wish-ful­fil­ments, but they do not fulfil the wishes of the instinctual impulses, but those of the crit­ical, cen­sur­ing and pun­ish­ing func­tion of the mind. If we are faced with a pure pun­ish­ment-dream, a simple mental oper­a­tion will enable us to rein­state the wish-dream to which the pun­ish­ment-dream was the proper rejoin­der; on account of this repu­di­ation, the pun­ish­ment-dream has appeared in place of the wish-dream as the mani­fest one. You know, ladies and gen­tle­men, that the study of dreams was the first thing that helped us to under­stand the neur­oses. And you will not be sur­prised to hear that our sub­sequent know­ledge of the neur­oses has influ­enced our con­cep­tion of the dream. As you will learn presently, we have been forced to assume the exist­ence in the mind of a spe­cial cri­ti­cising and for­bid­ding func­tion which we call the super-ego. Since we have now recog­nised the dream-cen­sor­ship as an activ­ity of this func­tion, we have been led to con­sider the part which the super-ego plays in dream-form­a­tion in greater detail.</p>
<p>Only two ser­i­ous dif­fi­culties face the wish-ful­fil­ment theory of dreams, the exam­in­a­tion of which leads us far afield and for which we have found no com­pletely sat­is­fact­ory solu­tion. The first dif­fi­culty is presen­ted by the fact that people who have had severe shocks or who have gone through ser­i­ous psychic trau­mas (such as were fre­quent during the war, and are also found to lie at the back of trau­matic hys­teria) are con­tinu­ally being put back into the trau­matic situ­ation in dreams. Accord­ing to our accept­a­tion of the func­tion of dreams, this ought not to be the case. What con­at­ive impulse could pos­sibly be sat­is­fied by this rein­state­ment of a most pain­ful trau­matic exper­i­ence? It is indeed hard to guess. We meet with the second fact almost daily in our ana­lyt­ical work; it does not involve such a ser­i­ous objec­tion as the other. You know that it is one of the tasks of psycho-ana­lysis to lift the veil of amne­sia which shrouds the earli­est years of child­hood and to bring the expres­sions of infant­ile sexual life which are hidden behind it into con­scious memory. Now these first sexual exper­i­ences of the child are bound up with pain­ful impres­sions of anxi­ety, pro­hib­i­tion, dis­ap­point­ment and pun­ish­ment. One can under­stand why they have been repressed; but, if so, it is dif­fi­cult to see why they should have such easy access to dream-life, why they should provide the pat­tern for so many dream-phant­as­ies, and why dreams are full of repro­duc­tions of these infant­ile scenes and allu­sions to them. The pain that attaches to them, and the wish-ful­filling tend­ency of the dream-work would seem to be incom­pat­ible. But per­haps in this case we exag­ger­ate the dif­fi­culty. All the imper­ish­able and unreal­is­able desires which provide the energy for the form­a­tion of dreams through­out one’s whole life are bound up with these same child­ish exper­i­ences, and one can well trust to their abil­ity with their power­ful upward thrust to force even mater­ial of a pain­ful nature to the sur­face. And, on the other hand, in the manner in which this mater­ial is repro­duced the efforts of the dream-work are unmis­tak­able; it dis­owns pain by means of dis­tor­tion and turns dis­ap­point­ment into ful­fil­ment. In the case of the trau­matic neur­oses it is quite dif­fer­ent; here the dream habitu­ally ends in anxi­ety. In my opin­ion we ought not to shirk the admis­sion that in such cases the func­tion of the dream fails. I will not have recourse to the saying that the excep­tion proves the rule; the valid­ity of this phrase seems to me very dubi­ous. But at any rate the excep­tion does not do away with the rule. If for the pur­poses of invest­ig­a­tion one isol­ates from every other mental pro­cess a single psychic activ­ity like the dream, one is enabled to dis­cover the laws which govern it; if one then puts it back into its place, one must be pre­pared to find that one’s dis­cov­er­ies are obscured and interfered with when they come into con­tact with other forces. We assert that the dream is a wish-ful­fil­ment; in order to take these last objec­tions into account, you may say that the dream is an <em>attemp­ted</em> wish-ful­fil­ment. But for those who have an under­stand­ing for the dynam­ics of the mind you will not be saying any­thing dif­fer­ent. Under cer­tain con­di­tions the dream can only achieve its end in a very incom­plete way, or has to aban­don it entirely; an uncon­scious fix­a­tion to the trauma seems to head the list of these obstacles to the dream-func­tion. The sleeper has to dream, because the nightly relax­a­tion of repres­sion allows the upward thrust of the trau­matic fix­a­tion to become active; but some­times his dream-work, which endeav­ours to change the memory traces of the trau­matic event into a wish-ful­fil­ment, fails to oper­ate. In these cir­cum­stances the result is that one becomes sleep­less; one gives up all idea of sleep because of one’s fear of the fail­ure of the dream-func­tion. The trau­matic neur­osis is an extreme case, but one must also attrib­ute a trau­matic char­ac­ter to infant­ile exper­i­ences as well; so one need not be sur­prised if lesser dis­turb­ances of the func­tion of the dream occur in other cir­cum­stances.</p>

<h2>Dreams And The Occult, Lec­ture XXX</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—To-day we are to travel along a narrow path, but it may lead us to a wide pro­spect.</p>
<p>When you hear that I am going to talk about the con­nec­tion between dreams and the occult, you need hardly feel sur­prised. Dreams are indeed often regarded as the portal to the world of mys­ti­cism, and even to-day seem to many to be in them­selves an occult phe­nomenon. Even we, who have made them an object of sci­entific study, cannot deny that sev­eral strands link them up with those obscure regions. Mys­ti­cism—Occult­ism—what is meant by these terms? Do not ima­gine that I shall attempt to provide you with a clear defin­i­tion of such hazy con­cepts. In a gen­eral and vague way we all know what we mean by the terms. They refer to a kind of ‘other world’ which lies beyond the clear world, with its inex­or­able laws, which sci­ence has built up for us.</p>
<p>Occult­ism assumes that there are in fact more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philo­sophy. Well, we need not be tied down by the narrow-minded­ness of the Schools; we are ready to believe whatever is made plaus­ible to us.</p>
<p>We intend to treat these things in just the same way as we treat any other mater­ial for sci­entific invest­ig­a­tion. First, we have to estab­lish whether these pro­cesses really occur, and then, but only then, when there is no doubt as to their actu­al­ity, we can set about their explan­a­tion. But we cannot hide from ourselves the fact that even the first step will be made dif­fi­cult for us by intel­lec­tual, psy­cho­lo­gical and his­tor­ical factors. It is by no means the same as when we start on any other invest­ig­a­tion.</p>
<p>Let us con­sider the intel­lec­tual dif­fi­culties first. Allow me to give you a crude, obvi­ous explan­a­tion of what I mean. Sup­pos­ing we are deal­ing with the con­sti­tu­tion of the interior of the earth. Admit­tedly we know noth­ing cer­tain about it. We sup­pose that it con­sists of heavy metals in a molten con­di­tion. Now let us ima­gine that some one asserts that the interior of the earth is made of water impreg­nated with car­bonic acid; that is to say, a kind of soda-water. We shall cer­tainly say that it is very improb­able, that it runs counter to all our expect­a­tions, and that it does not take into con­sid­er­a­tion the sci­entific data which have led us to put for­ward the mental hypo­thesis. But for all that it is not unthink­able. If any one shows us the way to prove the soda-water hypo­thesis, we shall follow it without any res­ist­ance. But now another person comes along who ser­i­ously asserts that the centre of the earth is made of jam. We shall behave quite dif­fer­ently towards his theory. We shall say to ourselves that jam is not a product of Nature but of human cook­ery; moreover, the exist­ence of that mater­ial pre­sup­poses the pres­ence of fruit-trees and their fruit, and we cannot see our way to pla­cing veget­a­tion and human cook­ery in the centre of the earth. The result of this intel­lec­tual objec­tion will be a diver­sion of our interests; instead of their being dir­ec­ted on to the invest­ig­a­tion itself, as to whether the interior of the earth is really made of jam or not, we shall wonder what kind of man it must be who can get such an idea into his head, or at the most we shall ask him where he got the idea from. The unfor­tu­nate inventor of the jam hypo­thesis will be very much offen­ded, and will com­plain that we are refus­ing to con­sider an object­ive eval­u­ation of this theory out of what he calls sci­entific pre­ju­dice. But his com­plaints will be in vain. Pre­ju­dices, we feel, are not always to be deplored, but are some­times jus­ti­fied; and they are useful in saving us unne­ces­sary trouble. They are, indeed, noth­ing more than con­clu­sions drawn by ana­logy from other well-foun­ded judg­ments.</p>
<p>A whole number of occult the­or­ies make the same impres­sion on us as the jam theory, so that we feel jus­ti­fied in put­ting them aside at the outset without test­ing them. But it is not quite such a simple matter. An ana­logy such as I have sug­ges­ted—like all ana­lo­gies—proves noth­ing. In any case it is doubt­ful whether it is a fair ana­logy, and it is obvi­ous that it was our atti­tude of scorn­ful rejec­tion which in the first instance determ­ined our choice of it. Pre­ju­dices are very often useful and jus­ti­fied, but some­times they are erro­neous and harm­ful, and one never knows when they will be the one or the other. The his­tory of Sci­ence is full of examples which should warn us against too hasty a con­dem­na­tion. For a long time it was thought to be an absurd thesis that the stones which we now call met­eor­ites should have reached the earth from outer space, or that moun­tains, the rocks of which con­tain remains of shells, should once have formed the bed of the sea. And, after all, not so very dif­fer­ent a fate befell our psycho-ana­lysis itself, when it brought for­ward the dis­cov­ery of the uncon­scious. We ana­lysts, there­fore, have spe­cial reason to be cau­tious in making use of intel­lec­tual argu­ments in the rejec­tion of new the­or­ies, and we must recog­nize that such argu­ments will not put us beyond the reach of feel­ings of aver­sion, doubt and uncer­tainty.</p>
<p>I called the second factor psy­cho­lo­gical: By that I meant the gen­eral human inclin­a­tion towards credu­lity and belief in the mar­vel­lous. From the very begin­ning, when life imposes its stern dis­cip­line upon us, there grows up in us a res­ist­ance against the rest­less­ness and mono­tony of the laws of thought, and against the need for put­ting things to the test of real­ity. Reason becomes an enemy that keeps us from so many pos­sib­il­it­ies of pleas­ure. One dis­cov­ers what a joy it is to escape from it at least for a moment, and give one­self up to the fas­cin­a­tion of irra­tion­al­ity. The school­boy amuses him­self by making up ridicu­lous plays on words, the spe­cial­ist makes fun of his own work after a sci­entific con­gress, and even the ser­i­ous-minded man enjoys an occa­sional joke. More ser­i­ous ant­ag­on­ism against ‘Wisdom and Sci­ence, man’s most prized powers,’ awaits its oppor­tun­ity; it is eager to prefer the mir­acle-man or the nat­ural healer to the ‘trained’ doctor, it makes us warm towards the the­or­ies of the Occult, so long as its reputed facts can be taken as breaches of law and rule. It puts our crit­ical fac­ulty to sleep, fals­i­fies our per­cep­tion, and forces us to con­firm and agree without real jus­ti­fic­a­tion. Any one who takes these human weak­nesses into con­sid­er­a­tion has every reason to dis­count the value of much of the inform­a­tion con­tained in occult lit­er­at­ure.</p>
<p>In refer­ring to the third obstacle as the his­tor­ical one I had in mind the fact that noth­ing new is to be found in the world of the occult. On the con­trary, we meet again in it with all the signs, won­ders, proph­ecies and appar­i­tions which have been handed down to us from remote ages and in old books, and which we long ago thought we had done with as being the off­spring of unbridled ima­gin­a­tion or tenden­tious fraud, the product of a time when the ignor­ance of man­kind was at its height and when the sci­entific spirit was still in its infancy. If we accept as true what we are told by the occult­ists of our own day, then we must be pre­pared to believe the accounts which have come down to us from the past. And then we remem­ber that the tra­di­tions and sacred books of all races are packed with such mar­vels, and that reli­gions base their claim to cred­ib­il­ity pre­cisely on such extraordin­ary and won­drous hap­pen­ings, and find in them the proof of the oper­a­tion of super­hu­man forces. At this point it is hard for us to avoid the sus­pi­cion that occult interests are really reli­gious ones, and that it is one of the secret motives of the occult­ist move­ments to come to the aid of reli­gious belief, threatened as it is by the pro­gress of sci­entific thought. The dis­cov­ery of a motive of this kind cannot fail to increase our mis­trust and our dis­in­clin­a­tion to embark upon an invest­ig­a­tion of these so-called occult phe­nom­ena.</p>
<p>But this dis­in­clin­a­tion must be over­come. The whole thing is really a ques­tion of fact: is what the occult­ists tell us true or not? It must be pos­sible to decide this by obser­va­tion. <em>Au fond</em> we ought to be grate­ful to the occult­ists. The tales of won­der­ful hap­pen­ings which have come down to us from ancient days are beyond our powers of test­ing. If we say that they cannot be proved, we must at least admit that, strictly speak­ing, they cannot be dis­proved. But about what hap­pens in the present, about things which we can actu­ally wit­ness, we ought to be able to reach a def­in­ite con­clu­sion. If we are con­vinced that such won­ders do not occur nowadays, we need not fear the objec­tion that they might have occurred in days gone by. Other explan­a­tions will then be far more plaus­ible. We have, then, put aside our scruples and are ready to take part in the obser­va­tion of occult phe­nom­ena.</p>
<p>Unfor­tu­nately we come up against con­sid­er­a­tions which are highly unfa­vour­able to our laud­able inten­tions. The obser­va­tions on which our judg­ments must depend have to be made under con­di­tions which render our powers of per­cep­tion insec­ure, and which blunt our fac­ulty of atten­tion; the phe­nom­ena take place in the dark or in the faint glim­mer of a red light after long peri­ods of fruit­less wait­ing. We are told that even our scep­tical—that is to say, our crit­ical—atti­tude may very well pre­vent the hoped for phe­nom­ena from mani­fest­ing them­selves. The situ­ation which thus arises is simply a cari­ca­ture of the con­di­tions under which we are used to car­ry­ing out sci­entific invest­ig­a­tions. The obser­va­tions are made on so-called medi­ums, per­sons to whom are ascribed spe­cial ‘sens­it­ive’ gifts, who, how­ever, do not dis­play out­stand­ing qual­it­ies of intel­li­gence or char­ac­ter, and who are not moved, as the old wonder-work­ers were, by some great idea or by some ser­i­ous pur­pose. On the con­trary, they are regarded as par­tic­u­larly untrust­worthy even by the people who believe in their mys­ter­i­ous powers; most of them have already been unmasked as frauds, and we are temp­ted to expect that the same will happen with the rest as well. Their per­form­ances remind us of the mis­chiev­ous pranks of a child or of a con­juror’s tricks. Noth­ing of any value has so far ever come out of these <em>séances</em> with medi­ums; no new source of energy has become access­ible to us. And, to be sure, one does not expect any advances in our know­ledge of pigeon-breed­ing from the tricks of a con­juror who pro­duces pigeons out of an empty top-hat. I can easily put myself into the pos­i­tion of a man who wishes to fulfil the demands of objectiv­ity and there­fore takes part in these occult <em>séances</em>, but tires of them after a while, and, put off by what is required of him, gives up the whole busi­ness and returns to his pre­ju­dices no wiser than before. To such a man one might object that his beha­viour is not right, and that if one is going to invest­ig­ate phe­nom­ena one cannot decide before­hand of what nature they shall be and under what con­di­tions they shall mani­fest them­selves. It is, on the con­trary, his busi­ness to per­severe and form some estim­ate of the pre­cau­tion­ary meas­ures of con­trol which are used nowadays as a pro­tec­tion against the untrust­wor­thi­ness of medi­ums. Unfor­tu­nately the modern con­trol tech­nique puts an end to the easy access­ib­il­ity of occult obser­va­tions. The study of the occult has become a spe­cial­ized and dif­fi­cult pur­suit, a form of activ­ity which one cannot carry on side by side with one’s other interests. And until the invest­ig­at­ors who have given their minds to it have come to some con­clu­sion, one is neces­sar­ily given over to doubts and to one’s own con­jec­tures.</p>
<p>Among these con­jec­tures the most prob­able is, I think, that in occult­ism there is a core of facts which have hitherto not been recog­nized, and round which fraud and phant­asy have woven a veil which it is hard to pen­et­rate. But how can we even approach this core? at what point can we grasp the prob­lem? It is here, it seems to me, that the dream comes to our aid by sug­gest­ing to us that we should pick out the theme of tele­pathy from all the con­fused mater­ial that sur­rounds it.</p>
<p>You know that by tele­pathy we mean the alleged fact that an event which occurs at a spe­cific time comes more or less sim­ul­tan­eously into the con­scious­ness of a person who is spa­tially dis­tant, without any of the known meth­ods of com­mu­nic­a­tion coming into play. The tacit assump­tion is that this event occurs to a person, in whom the receiver of the mes­sage has some strong emo­tional interest. Thus, for example, a person A has an acci­dent, or dies, and a person B, some one closely con­nec­ted with A, his mother or daugh­ter or loved one, learns of it at about the time of its occur­rence through a visual or aud­it­ory per­cep­tion; in the latter case it is as though they were in tele­phonic com­mu­nic­a­tion, which, how­ever, they are not; in fact, it is a kind of psychic par­al­lel to wire­less tele­graphy. I need not emphas­ise to you the improb­ab­il­ity of such pro­cesses, and anyway there are good grounds for reject­ing the major­ity of such reports. Some of them are left over which cannot be rejec­ted so easily, I must now ask you to allow me to leave out the pre­cau­tion­ary word ‘alleged’ for the pur­poses of what I have to tell you, and to let me con­tinue as though I believed in the object­ive real­ity of tele­pathic phe­nom­ena. But you must remem­ber all the time that this is not the case, that I have not com­mit­ted myself to any con­clu­sion on the sub­ject.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact I have but little to tell you—only one modest fact. And I will fur­ther dimin­ish your expect­a­tions by inform­ing you that fun­da­ment­ally the dream has but little to do with tele­pathy. Tele­pathy throws no new light on the nature of the dream, nor does the dream bear wit­ness for the real­ity of tele­pathy. Tele­pathic phe­nom­ena are also by no manner of means con­fined to dreams; they can also mani­fest them­selves during waking life. The only ground for men­tion­ing the con­nec­tion between dreams and tele­pathy is that the con­di­tion of sleep seems to be espe­cially suit­able for the recep­tion of tele­pathic com­mu­nic­a­tions. If then one comes across a so-called tele­pathic dream, one can con­vince one­self by its ana­lysis that the tele­pathic mes­sage has played the same role as any other residue of waking life, and as such has been altered by the dream-work and made to serve its pur­pose.</p>
<p>Now in the course of the ana­lysis of a tele­pathic dream of this kind some­thing occurred which seems to me of suf­fi­cient import­ance, in spite of its slight­ness, to serve as the start­ing-point of this lec­ture. When in the year 1922 I brought up this sub­ject for the first time, I had only one obser­va­tion at my dis­posal. Since then I have made sev­eral other obser­va­tions; but I shall keep to the first example, because it is the easi­est one to describe, and I shall pro­ceed at once to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>An obvi­ously intel­li­gent man, and one who, accord­ing to his own estim­a­tion, was in no way ‘tain­ted with occult­ism’ wrote to me about a dream which seemed to him to be remark­able. He pre­faced his story with the inform­a­tion that his mar­ried daugh­ter, who lived some dis­tance from him, was expect­ing her first con­fine­ment in the middle of Decem­ber. He was very much devoted to this daugh­ter, and he knew that she was very much attached to him. Now he dreamed in the night between the 16th and 17th of Novem­ber that his wife had had twins. There fol­lowed sev­eral details which I can pass over here, not all of which have found a sat­is­fact­ory explan­a­tion. The woman who, in the dream, had become the mother of the twins, was his second wife, the daugh­ter’s step-mother. He did not wish to have chil­dren by this woman, whom he did not con­sider fitted for bring­ing up chil­dren in an under­stand­ing way, and at the time of the dream he had for a long time given up sexual inter­course with her. What induced him to write to me was not a doubt about the valid­ity of the theory of dreams, though the mani­fest dream would have jus­ti­fied him if that had been the case; for why does the dream, in flat con­tra­dic­tion to his wishes, depict this woman as bear­ing chil­dren? And accord­ing to his story he had no grounds for fear­ing that this unwished-for occur­rence might take place. What determ­ined him to tell me about his dream was the fact that early in the morn­ing of Novem­ber 18th he received a tele­gram to say that his daugh­ter had given birth to twins. The tele­gram had been handed in the day before, and the birth had taken place during the night between the 16th and 17th, at about the same time that he had dreamt that his wife had had twins. The dreamer asked me whether I thought that the sim­ul­tan­eity of the dream and the event was a mere coin­cid­ence. He did not go far as to call the dream a tele­pathic one, because the dif­fer­ence between the con­tent of the dream and the event itself con­cerned pre­cisely what he con­sidered to be the most import­ant point, the person who had the chil­dren. But from one of his remarks it looked as though he would not have been sur­prised if he had had a real tele­pathic dream. His daugh­ter, he felt cer­tain, had ‘thought espe­cially about him’ during labour.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men, I am sure that you can already explain the dream, and that you under­stand why I have told it to you. Here is a man, dis­sat­is­fied with his second wife, who would prefer to have a wife like his daugh­ter by his first mar­riage. In the uncon­scious this ‘like’ is nat­ur­ally omit­ted. Now during the night he receives the tele­pathic com­mu­nic­a­tion that his daugh­ter has had twins. The dream-work seizes on this inform­a­tion, allows his uncon­scious wish that his daugh­ter should replace his second wife to act upon it, and thus emerges the sin­gu­lar mani­fest dream in which the wish itself is veiled and the mes­sage dis­tor­ted. We must admit that only dream-inter­pret­a­tion has shown us that this is a tele­pathic dream; psycho-ana­lysis has dis­covered a tele­pathic event which we should not oth­er­wise have recog­nized as such.</p>
<p>But do not let yourselves be led astray. In spite of all this, dream-inter­pret­a­tion has said noth­ing about the object­ive truth of tele­pathic phe­nom­ena. It may be only an appear­ance which can be explained in some other way. It is pos­sible that the man’s latent dream-thoughts ran like this: ‘To-day is the day on which the con­fine­ment must take place, if my daugh­ter, as I incid­ent­ally believe is the case, has been a month out in her cal­cu­la­tions. And her appear­ance when I saw her last time was such that it looked as though she was going to have twins. And my dead wife was so fond of chil­dren: how delighted she would have been by twins!’ (The last point is derived from asso­ci­ations of the dreamer which I have not yet men­tioned.) In that case the stim­u­lus for the dream would have been well-foun­ded sus­pi­cions on the part of the dreamer and not a tele­pathic mes­sage; the result would have been the same in both cases. You notice that even this inter­pret­a­tion has told us noth­ing about the ques­tion of whether one should assign object­ive real­ity to tele­pathy. One could only come to a con­clu­sion about that after making detailed enquir­ies into all the cir­cum­stances of the case, which unfor­tu­nately was impossible with this example, as it was with all the others in my exper­i­ence. We may grant that the assump­tion of tele­pathy gives us by far the simplest explan­a­tion; but that does not carry us very far. The simplest explan­a­tion is not always the right one, truth is very often not simple, and one must act with the greatest cau­tion before com­mit­ting one­self to such a far-reach­ing assump­tion.</p>
<p>We can now leave the sub­ject of dreams and tele­pathy; I have noth­ing more to say about it. But I want you to notice that it was not dreams that seemed to teach us some­thing about tele­pathy, but the inter­pret­a­tion of the dreams, the psycho-ana­lytic treat­ment of them. We can there­fore leave dreams on one side in what fol­lows, and we will exam­ine fur­ther our sus­pi­cion that the applic­a­tion of psycho-ana­lysis may throw a light on other so-called occult facts. There is, for example, the phe­nomenon of thought-trans­fer­ence, which is closely allied to tele­pathy and, indeed, can be iden­ti­fied with it without much dif­fi­culty. It is held that psy­cho­lo­gical pro­cesses, ideas, states of excite­ment, voli­tions, which occur in the mind of one person, can be trans­ferred through space to another, without the usual means of com­mu­nic­a­tion (words or signs) being employed. Incid­ent­ally it is remark­able that it is actu­ally these phe­nom­ena which find the least men­tion in the old accounts of the mira­cu­lous.</p>
<p>During the psycho-ana­lytic treat­ment of patients I have had the impres­sion that the activ­it­ies of pro­fes­sional for­tune-tell­ers provide an admir­able oppor­tun­ity for making really sat­is­fact­ory obser­va­tions of thought-trans­fer­ence. It is usu­ally mediocre and even inferior people who carry on prac­tices of this sort, deal out cards, study writ­ing and the lines upon the hand, or make astro­lo­gical reck­on­ings, and fore­tell the future of their vis­it­ors, after having shown some know­ledge of their past or present his­tory. Their cli­ents usu­ally express them­selves as sat­is­fied by their per­form­ances, and bear them no ill-will if their proph­ecies do not come true in the end. I have come across a great many such cases and have been able to study them ana­lyt­ic­ally. I will tell you the most remark­able instance of the kind. Unfor­tu­nately the evid­en­tial value of this inform­a­tion is reduced on account of the numer­ous omis­sions which are neces­sit­ated by the rules of pro­fes­sional secrecy. I have, how­ever, care­fully avoided any dis­tor­tions. This is the story of one of my female patients, who had an exper­i­ence of the kind we are dis­cuss­ing with a for­tune-teller.</p>
<p>She was the eldest of a family of broth­ers and sis­ters, grew up with an extraordin­ar­ily strong attach­ment to her father, had mar­ried young, and had found entire sat­is­fac­tion in her mar­ried life. There was only one thing want­ing to make her hap­pi­ness com­plete; she was child­less, and thus the hus­band whom she loved could not wholly fill the place of her father. When after many years she decided to have a gyn­ae­co­lo­gical oper­a­tion, her hus­band dis­closed to her the fact that the fault lay in him, that through an ill­ness which had occurred before mar­riage he had been rendered incap­able of pro­cre­at­ing chil­dren. She took this dis­ap­point­ment very badly, became neur­otic, and suffered unmis­tak­ably from dread of the hus­band’s attempts. In order to cheer her up, her hus­band took her with him on a busi­ness visit to Paris. While they were there, they were sit­ting one day in the hall of the hotel when she noticed a stir among the hotel ser­vants. She asked what was hap­pen­ing, and learnt that Mon­sieur le Pro­fes­seur had arrived and was giving con­sulta­tions in a cer­tain room. She expressed her wish to see what the thing was like her­self. Her hus­band tried to dis­suade her, but when he was not look­ing she slipped into the room where the for­tun­e­teller was giving his con­sulta­tions. She was twenty-seven years old, but looked much younger, and she had taken off her wed­ding-ring. Mon­sieur le Pro­fes­seur told her to rest her hand on a bowl filled with ashes, care­fully stud­ied the imprint, and, after telling her all sorts of things about severe troubles which lay before her, con­cluded with the com­fort­ing assur­ance that she would get mar­ried all the same and have two chil­dren by the time she was thirty-two years of age. When she told me this story she was forty-three, very ill, and with no expect­a­tion of ever having a child at all. The proph­ecy there­fore had not come true, and yet she spoke of it with no bit­ter­ness whatever, but with an unmis­tak­able expres­sion of sat­is­fac­tion, as though she were look­ing back with pleas­ure upon a happy exper­i­ence. It was easy to assure one­self that she had not the slight­est idea what the two num­bers in the proph­ecy might mean, or whether they meant any­thing at all.</p>
<p>You will say that this is a stupid and incom­pre­hens­ible story, and ask why I have related it to you. Now I should feel exactly as you do, but for the fact—and this is the import­ant point—that the ana­lysis enabled us to obtain an inter­pret­a­tion of the proph­ecy, which was actu­ally most sig­ni­fic­ant when it came to the details. For the two num­bers have a place in the life of the <em>mother</em> of my patient. She had mar­ried late, when she was more than thirty, and her family had often remarked how suc­cess­ful she had been in making up for lost time. Her two first chil­dren—and our patient was the elder of these—had been born within a single cal­en­dar year with the smal­lest pos­sible inter­val between them; and it was really true of her that by the time she was thirty-two she had two chil­dren. What Mon­sieur le Pro­fes­seur told my patient meant this: ‘Cheer up, for you are still young! You will have the same exper­i­ence as your mother, who also had to wait a long time for chil­dren, and you will have two chil­dren by the time you are thirty-two.’ But to have the same exper­i­ence as her mother, to be in her pos­i­tion, to take her place with her father, was the strongest wish of her child­hood, the wish whose non-ful­fil­ment was begin­ning to make her ill. The proph­ecy prom­ised her that it would be ful­filled, how could she feel oth­er­wise than friendly towards the prophet? But do you think that Mon­sieur le Pro­fes­seur could really have been famil­iar with the dates of the intim­ate family his­tory of a chance client? It is impossible; whence, then, came the know­ledge that enabled him to express in his proph­ecy the strongest and most secret wish of my patient by bring­ing in these two num­bers? I can see only two pos­sib­il­it­ies. Either the story, as she told it me, was not true and the events were dif­fer­ent, or we must accept thought-trans­fer­ence as a real phe­nom­ena. It could, no doubt, be argued that my patient, after the lapse of six­teen years, had car­ried over the two num­bers we are dis­cuss­ing from her uncon­scious into her recol­lec­tion. I have no evid­ence for this sug­ges­tion, but I cannot rule it out, and I ima­gine that you would prefer to believe in such an explan­a­tion rather than in the real­ity of thought-trans­fer­ence. If, how­ever, you should accept the latter view, do not forget that it was only ana­lysis that brought to light the occult ele­ment, which had been dis­tor­ted out of all recog­ni­tion.</p>
<p>If we had to deal with only <em>one</em> case like that of my patient, we should turn away from it with a shrug of the shoulders. It would not occur to any one to base a belief which has such far-reach­ing implic­a­tions on an isol­ated obser­va­tion. But I can assure you that this is not the only case in my exper­i­ence. I have col­lec­ted a whole set of such proph­ecies, and I have the impres­sion that in every instance the for­tune-teller has only given expres­sion to the thoughts, and par­tic­u­larly to the secret wishes, of his cli­ents; so that we are jus­ti­fied in ana­lys­ing such proph­ecies as if they were the sub­ject­ive pro­duc­tions, phant­as­ies or dreams of the people con­cerned. Nat­ur­ally not all cases have equal evid­en­tial value, nor in all cases is it equally pos­sible to rule out more rational explan­a­tions; but taking all the evid­ence together there remains a heavy weight of prob­ab­il­ity in favour of the real­ity of thought-trans­fer­ence. The import­ance of the matter would jus­tify my put­ting all my cases before you; but I cannot do that because the mater­ial would be of inor­din­ate length and would inev­it­ably involve a breach of pro­fes­sional secrecy. I will try to salve my con­science as far as pos­sible by giving you one or two more examples.</p>
<p>One day a very intel­li­gent young man came to see me. He was a stu­dent, pre­par­ing for his final med­ical exam­in­a­tion; but he was not in a con­di­tion to take it, because, as he com­plained, he had lost all his interests, all power of con­cen­tra­tion, and even the fac­ulty of a well-ordered memory. The his­tory of this para­lys­ing con­di­tion was soon unrav­elled: he had fallen ill after car­ry­ing through a line of con­duct which had neces­sit­ated great self-dis­cip­line. He had a sister towards whom he felt, just as she did towards him, an intense but always restrained affec­tion. They had often enough said to each other: ‘What a shame it is that we cannot marry!’ An unob­jec­tion­able man had fallen in love with the sister, and she had returned his feel­ing, but her par­ents would not give their con­sent to the union. The couple had turned to my patient for help, and he had not refused it. He had enabled them to cor­res­pond with each other, and it had been due to his influ­ence that the par­ents had even­tu­ally been per­suaded to give their con­sent. While they were engaged, a chance occur­rence had taken place, whose sig­ni­fic­ance it is easy to guess. He and his future brother-in-law under­took a dif­fi­cult climb without a guide; they lost their way, and were in danger of never return­ing alive. Shortly after the mar­riage of his sister he had fallen into his present state of mental exhaus­tion.</p>
<p>When he had become able to work as a result of psycho-ana­lysis, he left me to take his exam­in­a­tion; but after he had got through it he came back to me in the autumn of the same year for a short period. He then told me of a remark­able exper­i­ence which he had had before the summer. In his uni­ver­sity town there lived a for­tune-teller, who car­ried on a very suc­cess­ful prac­tice there. Even the princes of the reign­ing house used to con­sult her reg­u­larly before under­tak­ing any import­ant step. The way in which she worked was very simple. She asked for the facts con­cern­ing the birth of the person involved, but wanted to know noth­ing else about him, not even his name. She then con­sul­ted her astro­lo­gical books, made long cal­cu­la­tions and in the end made a proph­ecy about him. My patient decided to make use of her secret arts in con­nec­tion with his brother-in-law. He vis­ited her and gave her the requis­ite data about him. After she had made her cal­cu­la­tions she pro­nounced the fol­low­ing proph­ecy: ‘This person will die in July or August of this year of poison from eating crabs or oysters.’ My patient fin­ished his story by explain­ing: ‘And that really was mar­vel­lous!’</p>
<p>From the very begin­ning, I had listened to his story without enthu­si­asm; and after this exclam­a­tion I per­mit­ted myself to ask: ‘What is it that makes you find this proph­ecy so mar­vel­lous? We have already reached the late autumn, and your brother-in-law is not dead yet, or you would have told me long ago. The proph­ecy there­fore has not come true.’ ‘The proph­ecy—no,’ he said, ‘but the remark­able thing is this. My brother-in-law is pas­sion­ately fond of crabs and oysters, and last summer, that is to say before my visit to the for­tune-teller, he was poisoned by eating oysters, and nearly died of it.’ What could I say about it? I could only feel dis­tressed that such an intel­li­gent man, and moreover one who had a sat­is­fact­ory ana­lysis behind him, should not have seen through the whole thing more clearly. For my part, before I believe that one can cal­cu­late the onset of shell­fish-pois­on­ing by con­sult­ing astro­lo­gical tables, I would rather sup­pose that my patient had not yet over­come his hatred towards his rival, the repres­sion of which had caused his own ill­ness, and that the lady astro­lo­ger simply gave voice to his own hope: ‘People never give up such tastes, and one day they will really be the end of him.’ I admit that I can find no other explan­a­tion for this case, except per­haps that my patient was making a joke at my expense. But neither then nor later did he give me any grounds for such a sus­pi­cion, and he seemed to mean quite ser­i­ously what he said.</p>
<p>Here is another case. A young man of good pos­i­tion had a mis­tress, and showed a remark­able obses­sion in his rela­tions with her. From time to time he was impelled to wound her feel­ings with insult­ing remarks till she was reduced to des­pair. When he had got her into this con­di­tion he felt relieved, made it up with her and gave her presents. But now he wanted to free him­self from her, for the obses­sion was becom­ing a worry to him: he noticed that his pro­fes­sional life was suf­fer­ing from the rela­tion­ship, and wanted to have a wife and family of his own. Since, how­ever, he could not get away from his mis­tress by his own efforts, he came to ana­lysis for help. After one of these scenes, which occurred during the ana­lysis, he got her to write him a few words on a piece of paper and showed it to a graph­o­lo­gist. The inform­a­tion he received from him was to the effect that this was the hand­writ­ing of a person in the depths of des­pair, who would cer­tainly commit sui­cide in the course of the next few days. That event did not indeed come about, for the lady remained alive, but the ana­lyt­ical treat­ment enabled him to free him­self from his fet­ters; he left the lady, and turned his atten­tions to a young girl who he thought would make him a good wife. Soon after­wards he had a dream which could only be explained as due to an incip­i­ent doubt about the young girl’s worth. He obtained a spe­ci­men of her hand­writ­ing as well, which he placed before the same author­ity, and received a judg­ment on it which con­firmed his anxi­et­ies. He there­fore gave up his inten­tion of making her his wife.</p>
<p>To estim­ate the reports of the hand­writ­ing expert, and par­tic­u­larly the first one, at their proper value, one must know some­thing of the private his­tory of our sub­ject. In his early adoles­cent years he was madly in love with a young woman, some years older than him­self, in the pas­sion­ate way that was char­ac­ter­istic of him. She rejec­ted him and he thereupon attemp­ted sui­cide; nor can we doubt the ser­i­ous­ness of his inten­tion. It was only by a mir­acle that he escaped death, and it was only after care­ful nurs­ing that he recovered. But this reck­less act made a deep impres­sion upon the woman he was in love with; she respon­ded to his atten­tions, and became his mis­tress. From that time onwards he had a deep attach­ment to her, and served her in a truly devoted manner. After more than two dec­ades, when they had both lost some­thing of their youth, the woman nat­ur­ally more than he, he felt the need of detach­ing him­self from her; he wanted to be free, to lead his own life, and to have a house and family of his own. And at the same time that he felt this dis­sat­is­fac­tion, there sprang up in him the long-sup­pressed need for revenge upon her. Just as at first he had tried to commit sui­cide him­self, because she rejec­ted him, so now he wanted to have the sat­is­fac­tion of seeing her seek destruc­tion because he was leav­ing her. But his love was still too strong for this wish to become con­scious; nor was he able to behave badly enough to her to drive her to commit sui­cide. In this frame of mind he took on the mis­tress whom I first men­tioned as a kind of whip­ping-boy, in order to sat­isfy his thirst for revenge in <em>cor­pore vili</em>, and inflic­ted on her all the injur­ies cal­cu­lated to pro­duce in her the effect he desired to pro­duce in the woman he loved. The fact that the revenge was actu­ally dir­ec­ted towards the latter was only betrayed by the cir­cum­stances that he made her a con­fed­er­ate and advisor in his love-affair, instead of hiding his lapse from her. The unfor­tu­nate woman, who had sunk from the pos­i­tion of giving favours to that of receiv­ing them, prob­ably suffered from his con­fid­ences more than the new mis­tress did from his bru­tal­ity. The obses­sion of which he com­plained in ref­er­ence to the latter, and which brought him under ana­lytic treat­ment, had nat­ur­ally been trans­ferred from his first mis­tress to her; it was from his first mis­tress that he wanted to free him­self and could not. I am no hand­writ­ing expert, and I do not think much of the art of guess­ing char­ac­ter from hand­writ­ing; still less do I believe in the pos­sib­il­ity of fore­tell­ing the future of the writer in that way. You see, how­ever, that, whatever one may think of the value of graph­o­logy, it is undeni­able that the expert, when he prom­ised that the writer of the spe­ci­men which had been brought to him would commit sui­cide during the next few days, had once more only brought to light a very strong secret wish on the part of the person who was asking his opin­ion. Some­thing sim­ilar happened in the case of the second report, only that here we are not con­cerned with an uncon­scious wish; here it was the incip­i­ent doubts and anxi­et­ies of the inquirer that found overt expres­sion through the mouth of the hand­writ­ing spe­cial­ist. I may add that my patient was able with the help of ana­lysis to make a love-choice out­side the magic circle within which he had been spell-bound.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—You have now heard what dream-inter­pret­a­tion and psycho-ana­lysis in gen­eral can do for occult­ism. You have seen by means of examples that, through the applic­a­tion of psycho-ana­lytic theory, occult phe­nom­ena have been revealed which would oth­er­wise have remained unre­cog­nised. The ques­tion which doubt­less interests you most, whether we ought to believe in the object­ive real­ity of the phe­nom­ena, is one which psycho-ana­lysis cannot answer dir­ectly; but at least the mater­ial which it has helped to bring to light is favour­able to an affirm­at­ive reply. But your interest will not stop there. You will want to know to what con­clu­sion that far richer vein of mater­ial, with which psycho-ana­lysis has noth­ing whatever to do, leads us. There, how­ever, I cannot follow you; it is no longer my province. The only thing I can do, is to tell you of some obser­va­tions, which at any rate have some­thing to do with psycho-ana­lysis in the sense that they were made during ana­lyt­ical treat­ment, and were per­haps rendered pos­sible by means of it. I will give you one example, the one which left the strongest impres­sion with me; it will be long-winded, and you will have to keep a number of details in your minds, and even so a great deal will have to be omit­ted which increased the evid­en­tial value of the obser­va­tion. It is an instance in which the phe­nom­ena in which we are inter­ested came to light quite obvi­ously and did not have to be brought out by ana­lysis. In dis­cuss­ing it, how­ever, we shall not be able to do without ana­lysis. But I ought to warn you before­hand that even this example of appar­ent thought-trans­fer­ence in the ana­lytic situ­ation is not proof against all objec­tions, and does not war­rant uncon­di­tional accept­ance of the real­ity of occult phe­nom­ena.</p>
<p>The story is this. One autumn day in the year 1919, at about 10.45 a.m., Dr. David For­syth, who had just arrived from London, sent in his card while I was work­ing with a patient. (My respec­ted col­league from the Uni­ver­sity of London will, I feel sure, not think I am being indis­creet if I tell you that he came to me for some months to be ini­ti­ated into the mys­ter­ies of psy­cho­ana­lyt­ical tech­nique.) I had only time to say ‘How do you do?’, and arrange an appoint­ment for later on. Dr. For­syth had a spe­cial claim upon my interest; for he was the first for­eigner who came to me after the isol­a­tion of the war years, and seemed to be a har­binger of better times. Soon after this, at eleven o’clock, my next patient arrived, a Mr. P., an intel­li­gent and charm­ing man of between forty and fifty, who had come to me because he exper­i­enced dif­fi­culties in sexual inter­course with women. In his case there was no pro­spect of bring­ing about a cure, and I had long ago sug­ges­ted that he should break off the treat­ment; but he had pre­ferred to con­tinue it, obvi­ously because he felt com­fort­able in a well-tempered father-trans­fer­ence upon myself. Money played no part at this time, because there was too little of it about. The hours I spent with him were stim­u­lat­ing for me as well, and a relax­a­tion, and so, set­ting aside the strict rules of med­ical etiquette, we were going on with the ana­lytic treat­ment for a spe­cified length of time.</p>
<p>On this par­tic­u­lar day P. rever­ted to his attempts at sexual inter­course with women, and men­tioned once more the pretty, piquante girl, in poor cir­cum­stances, with whom he might have been suc­cess­ful if only the fact of her vir­gin­ity had not frightened him off from taking any ser­i­ous steps. He had often spoken of her, but that day he told me for the first time that she, though nat­ur­ally she had not the slight­est idea of the real grounds of his dif­fi­culty, used to call him Mr. Foresight [<em>Vor­sicht</em>]. I was much struck by this piece of inform­a­tion; Dr. For­syth’s card was beside me, and I showed it to him.</p>
<p>These are the facts. I dare say they will seem to you to be rather thin; but if you will have patience you will find that there is more to come.</p>
<p>P. had spent some years of his youth in Eng­land, and had retained a last­ing interest in Eng­lish lit­er­at­ure. He pos­sessed a well-stocked lib­rary of Eng­lish books, which he used to lend me, and it is to him that I owe my acquaint­ance with authors such as Arnold Ben­nett and Gals­worthy, of whose works I had so far read but little. One day he lent me a novel by Gals­worthy called <em>The Man of Prop­erty</em>, the sub­ject of which is an ima­gin­ary family named For­syte. Gals­worthy’s ima­gin­a­tion was obvi­ously cap­tured by this cre­ation of his, because in the later stor­ies he repeatedly went back to mem­bers of this family, and even­tu­ally col­lec­ted all the stor­ies which had to do with them under the head­ing of <em>The For­syte Saga</em>. Only a few days before the event I am telling you about, P. had brought me a new volume out of this series. The name For­syte and all that it typ­i­fied for the author, had played a part in my con­ver­sa­tions with P.; it had become a part of the private lan­guage which so easily grows up between two people who see each other reg­u­larly. Now the name For­syte out of the novels is not very dif­fer­ent from that of my vis­itor For­syth (as pro­nounced by a German, indeed, they are hardly dis­tin­guish­able), and the express­ive Eng­lish word ‘foresight,’ which means ‘<em>Voraus­sicht</em>’ or ‘<em>Vor­sicht</em>,’ would be pro­nounced in the same way. P. had, there­fore, pro­duced from his own per­sonal exper­i­ences a name that was in my mind at the same time on account of a cir­cum­stance quite unknown to him.</p>
<p>As you see, we are making some pro­gress. But I think we shall be even more strongly impressed by this remark­able occur­rence and get some sort of insight into the con­di­tions of its origin, if we turn the light of ana­lysis on to two other asso­ci­ations which P. brought up during the same hour.</p>
<p>First: One day in the pre­ced­ing week I was expect­ing Mr. P. at 11 o’clock, but he had not appeared, and I went out to pay a call on Dr. Anton v. Freund at his pen­sion. I was sur­prised to find that Mr. P. lived on another floor of the same house in which the pen­sion was. Refer­ring to this later, I told P. that I had in a sense paid him a visit at his house; but I am abso­lutely cer­tain that I did not men­tion the name of the person whom I had vis­ited in the pen­sion, and now, soon after the men­tion of Mr. Foresight, he asked me the fol­low­ing ques­tion: ‘Is the lady called Freud-Ottorego who gives the Eng­lish course at the Volks-uni­ver­stät your daugh­ter by any chance?’ And for the first time in our long acquaint­ance he let slip the dis­tor­ted form of my name, to which offi­cials, clerks, and print­ers have accus­tomed me; instead of Freud, he said Freund.</p>
<p>Secondly: At the end of the hour he told me a dream, out of which he had woken with a feel­ing of anxi­ety, a reg­u­lar ‘<em>Alptraum</em>’ [<em>night­mare</em>] he called it. He added that he had recently for­got­ten the Eng­lish word for it, and had told some one who had asked him, that the Eng­lish for ‘<em>Alptraum</em>’ was ‘a mare’s nest.’ That is of course, absurd, because ‘a mare’s nest’ means noth­ing of the sort, and the cor­rect trans­la­tion of ‘<em>Alptraum</em>’ is ‘night­mare.’ This asso­ci­ation seemed to have noth­ing more in common with the others than the ele­ment of ‘Eng­lish’; but he reminded me of a trivial occur­rence which had happened about a month before. P. was sit­ting in my room with me, when there appeared quite unex­pec­tedly another wel­come guest from London, Dr. Ernest Jones, whom I had not seen for a long time. I nodded to him to go into my other room until I had fin­ished with P. The latter recog­nised him at once, how­ever, from a pho­to­graph of him which hung in the wait­ing-room, and even asked to be intro­duced to him. Now Jones is the author of a mono­graph on the night­mare. I did not know whether P. was acquain­ted with the book; he avoided read­ing ana­lyt­ical lit­er­at­ure.</p>
<p>At this point I should like to con­sider what ana­lyt­ical under­stand­ing we can obtain of P.’s asso­ci­ations and their motiv­a­tions. P. had the same atti­tude towards the name For­syte as I had; it meant the same to him as it did to me, and in fact it was to him that I owed my know­ledge of the name. The remark­able thing was that he brought this name into the ana­lysis imme­di­ately after it had acquired another mean­ing for me through a recent exper­i­ence, namely the arrival of the phys­i­cian from London. But per­haps not less inter­est­ing is the way in which the name came up in his ana­lyt­ical hour. He did not say: ‘Now the name For­syte, out of the novels you have read, comes into my mind,’ but, without any con­scious ref­er­ence to this source, he man­aged to weave it into his own per­sonal exper­i­ences and brought it to the sur­face in that way—a thing which might have happened long before, but which had not as a matter of fact occurred until now. At this junc­ture, how­ever, he said: ‘I am a For­syte, too, for that is what the girl called me.’ One cannot mis­take the mix­ture of exact­ing jeal­ousy and plaint­ive self-depre­ci­ation which finds expres­sion in this utter­ance. We shall not go far wrong if we com­plete it thus: ‘I am hurt that your thoughts should be so much wrapped up in this new-comer. Come back to me; after all, I am a For­syth too,—or rather only a Mr. Foresight, as the girl called me.’ And now, start­ing from the idea of ‘Eng­lish,’ his train of thought worked back to two earlier situ­ations, which might very well have aroused the same jeal­ousy in him. ‘A few days ago you paid a visit at my house, but, alas, it was not to me, it was to a Herr v. Freund.’ This idea made him dis­tort the name Freud into Freund. The name Freud-Ottorego from the lec­ture list came in, because as the name of a teacher of Eng­lish it paved the way for the mani­fest asso­ci­ation. And now the memory of another vis­itor of a few weeks back presen­ted itself, a vis­itor towards whom he cer­tainly felt just as jeal­ous, this vis­itor (Dr. Jones) was at the same time in a super­ior pos­i­tion to him, because he could write a book about night­mares, while the best he could do was to have night­mares him­self. The allu­sion to his mis­take about the mean­ing of a ‘mare’s nest’ belonged to the same con­nec­tion; it must mean: ‘I am not a proper Eng­lish­man after all, any more than I am a proper For­syth.’</p>
<p>Now it could not be said that his jeal­ous feel­ings were either inap­pro­pri­ate or incom­pre­hens­ible. He had already been made aware that his ana­lysis, and with it our rela­tions, would come to an end as soon as for­eign pupils and patients began to return to Vienna; and this is actu­ally what happened shortly after­wards. But what we have just been doing has been a piece of ana­lyt­ical work: the explan­a­tion of three ideas which were brought up in the same hour and were determ­ined by the same motiv­a­tion. This has not much to do with the ques­tion whether these ideas could have been pro­duced without thought-trans­fer­ence or not. The latter ques­tion applies to each of the three ideas, and can thus be divided into three sep­ar­ate ques­tions. Could P. have known that Dr. For­syth had just paid his first visit to me? Could he have known the name of the person whom I vis­ited in his house? Did he know that Dr. Jones had writ­ten a book about night­mares? Or was it only my know­ledge of these things which was dis­played in the ideas that came into his head? Whether this obser­va­tion of mine leads to a con­clu­sion in favour of thought-trans­fer­ence depends on the answer which is given to these sep­ar­ate ques­tions. Let us leave the first ques­tion aside for the moment, as the two others are easier to deal with. The case of the visit to the pen­sion strikes one at first sight as being very con­vin­cing. I am quite sure that in my short humor­ous men­tion of my visit to his house I did not men­tion any name; I think it is most improb­able that P. made inquir­ies in the pen­sion to dis­cover the name of the person I had called on; in fact, I believe that he never knew of his exist­ence. But the evid­en­tial value of this case is under­mined by a chance factor. The man whom I had been to see in the pen­sion was not only <em>called</em> Freund, but was indeed a true <em>friend</em> to us all. It was he whose gen­er­os­ity had made pos­sible the found­ing of our pub­lish­ing-house. His early death, and that of Karl Abra­ham a few years later, were the most ser­i­ous mis­for­tunes which have befallen the devel­op­ment of psycho-ana­lysis. It is pos­sible, there­fore, that I said to Mr. P.: ‘I have been vis­it­ing a friend at your house,’ and with this pos­sib­il­ity the occult interest of the second asso­ci­ation evap­or­ates.</p>
<p>The impres­sion made by the third asso­ci­ation, too, soon fades. Could P. have known that Jones had pub­lished a mono­graph on the night­mare, seeing that he never read ana­lyt­ical lit­er­at­ure? Yes, he could. He pos­sessed books issued by our pub­lish­ing-house, and he might cer­tainly have seen the titles of new pub­lic­a­tions prin­ted on the covers. It cannot be proved, but it cannot be dis­proved. Along this road, then, we can come to no decision. This example of mine, I regret to say, is open to the same objec­tions as so many others. It was writ­ten down too late, and came up for dis­cus­sion at a time when I was not seeing Mr. P. any more, and could not ask him any fur­ther ques­tions.</p>
<p>Let us return to the first asso­ci­ation, which even by itself would sup­port the alleged occur­rence of thought-trans­fer­ence. Could P. have known that Dr. For­syth had been with me a quarter of an hour before him? Could he even have known of his exist­ence or of his pres­ence in Vienna? We must not give way to the tempta­tion to answer both ques­tions straight off in the neg­at­ive. I might very well have told Mr. P. I was expect­ing a phys­i­cian from Eng­land for train­ing in ana­lysis, the first dove after the deluge. This might have happened in the summer of 1919; Dr. For­syth had made arrange­ments with me by letter, months before his arrival. I may even have men­tioned his name, though that is most improb­able. In view of the other asso­ci­ation which the name had for us both, the men­tion of it would inev­it­ably have led to a con­ver­sa­tion of which some trace at least would have been pre­served in my memory. Nev­er­the­less such a con­ver­sa­tion may have taken place and I may have totally for­got­ten it, so that it became pos­sible for the men­tion of Mr. Foresight in the ana­lyt­ical hour to strike me as mira­cu­lous. If one regards one­self as a scep­tic, it is as well from time to time to be scep­tical about one’s scep­ti­cism. Per­haps I too have that secret lean­ing towards the mira­cu­lous which meets the pro­duc­tion of occult phe­nom­ena half-way.</p>
<p>Even if one part of this mira­cu­lous occur­rence is thus explained away, we still have another part on our hands, and that the most dif­fi­cult part of all. Gran­ted that Mr. P. knew that there was such a person as Dr. For­syth and that he was expec­ted in Vienna in the autumn, how was it that my patient became sens­it­ive to him on the very day of his arrival and imme­di­ately after his first visit? We might say that it was chance, that is, we might leave it unex­plained; but I have men­tioned the two other ideas which occurred to Mr. P. pre­cisely in order to exclude chance, in order to show you that he really was occu­pied with jeal­ous thoughts dir­ec­ted against people who vis­ited me, and whom I vis­ited. Or, if we are anxious not to over­look any­thing even remotely pos­sible, we might sup­pose that P. noticed that I was in a state of unusual excite­ment, a state of which I was cer­tainly not aware, and that he drew his infer­ence from that. Or that Mr. P., who after all had arrived only a quarter of an hour after the Eng­lish­man, had met him in the imme­di­ate neigh­bour­hood of my house, that he had recog­nised him from his typ­ic­ally Eng­lish appear­ance, and with his jeal­ous feel­ings on the alert, had imme­di­ately thought: ‘Ah, there is Dr. For­syth, whose arrival means the end of my ana­lysis; and prob­ably he has just left the Pro­fessor.’ I cannot go any fur­ther into these ration­al­istic hypo­theses. We are left once more with a <em>non liquet</em>, but I must con­fess that here too I feel that the bal­ance is in favour of thought-trans­fer­ence. For the matter of that, I am cer­tainly not the only person who has met with ‘occult’ phe­nom­ena in the ana­lytic situ­ation. Helene Deutsch in 1926 repor­ted some obser­va­tions of the same kind, and stud­ied the way in which they were con­di­tioned by the rela­tion of trans­fer­ence between the patient and the ana­lyst.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will not be sat­is­fied with my pos­i­tion with regard to this prob­lem—not com­pletely con­vinced and yet ready to be con­vinced. Per­haps you will say to yourselves: ‘Here is another example of a person who has all his life been a steady-going man of sci­ence, and is now in his old age becom­ing weak-minded, reli­gious and cred­u­lous. I know that some great names belong in that cat­egory, but you must not reckon mine among them. At least I have not grown reli­gious, and I hope I have not become cred­u­lous.’ If one has humbled one­self all one’s life long in order to avoid pain­ful con­flict with facts, one tends to keep one’s back bowed in one’s old age before any new facts which may appear. No doubt you would far prefer that I should hold fast to a mod­er­ate theism, and turn relent­lessly against any­thing occult. But I am not con­cerned to seek any one’s favour, and I must sug­gest to you that you should think more kindly of the object­ive pos­sib­il­ity of thought-trans­fer­ence and there­fore also of tele­pathy.</p>
<p>You must not forget that I have only dealt with the prob­lem here in so far as one can approach it from the dir­ec­tion of psycho-ana­lysis. When I turned my thoughts towards it more than ten years ago, I too felt afraid lest our sci­entific out­look might be endangered and have to give way to spir­itu­al­ism or mys­ti­cism if occult phe­nom­ena were proved to be true. I think oth­er­wise now; it seems to me that one is dis­play­ing no great trust in sci­ence if one cannot rely on it to accept and deal with any occult hypo­thesis that may turn out to be cor­rect. And as regards thought-trans­fer­ence in par­tic­u­lar, it would seem actu­ally to favour the exten­sion of the sci­entific (or, as oppon­ents would say, mech­an­istic) way of think­ing on to the elu­sive world of the mind. For the tele­pathic pro­cess is sup­posed to con­sist in a mental act of one person giving rise to the same mental act in another. What lies between the two mental acts may very well be a phys­ical pro­cess, into which the mental pro­cess trans­forms itself at one end and which is trans­formed back into the same mental pro­cess at the other. The ana­logy with other trans­form­a­tions, such as speak­ing and hear­ing across the tele­phone, is an obvi­ous one. And think what it would mean if one could get hold of this phys­ical equi­val­ent of the mental act! I should like to point out that by insert­ing the uncon­scious between the phys­ical and what has hitherto been regarded as the mental, psycho-ana­lysis has pre­pared the way for the accept­ance of such pro­cesses as tele­pathy. If one gets used to the idea of tele­pathy one can account for a great deal by means of it, so far, of course, only in ima­gin­a­tion. It is a famil­iar fact that we have no notion of how the com­munal will of the great insect states comes about. Pos­sibly it works by means of mental trans­fer­ence of this direct kind. One is led to con­jec­ture that this may be the ori­ginal archaic method by which indi­vidu­als under­stood one another, and which has been pushed into the back­ground in the course of phylo­gen­etic devel­op­ment by the better method of com­mu­nic­a­tion by means of signs appre­hen­ded by the sense organs. But such older meth­ods may have per­sisted in the back­ground, and may still mani­fest them­selves under cer­tain con­di­tions: for example, in crowds roused to a state of pas­sion­ate excite­ment. All of this is highly spec­u­lat­ive and full of unsolved prob­lems, but there is no need to be alarmed by it.</p>
<p>If tele­pathy is a real pro­cess, one may, in spite of the dif­fi­culty of proof, sup­pose that it is quite a common phe­nomenon. It would fit in with our expect­a­tions if we could show that it occurs par­tic­u­larly in the mental life of chil­dren. One is reminded of the fre­quent fear felt by chil­dren that their par­ents know all their thoughts without having been told them—a fear which is a com­plete par­al­lel to, and per­haps the origin of, the belief of adults in the omni­science of God. A short time ago a trust­worthy observer, Dorothy Burl­ing­ham, pub­lished some find­ings in a paper called ‘Child Ana­lysis and the Mother,’ which, if they are con­firmed, must put an end to any remain­ing doubts of the real­ity of thought-trans­fer­ence. She took as her start­ing-point a number of those cases (now no longer rare) in which a mother and child are being ana­lysed at the same time, and repor­ted such remark­able phe­nom­ena as the fol­low­ing. One day in her ana­lytic hour the mother was talk­ing about a gold coin which had figured in one of her child­hood exper­i­ences. Imme­di­ately after­wards, when she had returned home, her little ten-year-old boy came into her room and brought her a gold coin to keep for him. She was aston­ished and asked him where he had got it from. He had been given it on his birth­day, but that was sev­eral months ago, and there was no reason why the child should have remembered the gold coin just then. The mother told the ana­lyst about the coin­cid­ence, and asked her to try to find out from the child why he had behaved in this way. But the ana­lysis of the child eli­cited noth­ing; the action had made its way into the child’s life that day like a for­eign body. A few weeks later the mother was sit­ting at her writ­ing table, in order to make a note of the occur­rence, as she had been asked to do. At that moment the boy came in and asked for the gold coin back, saying that he wanted to take it to show his ana­lyst. Once more the child’s ana­lysis dis­closed noth­ing that led up to the wish.</p>
<p>And with that we return to our start­ing-point—the study of psycho-ana­lysis.</p>

<h2>The Ana­tomy Of The Mental Per­son­al­ity, Lec­ture XXXI</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—I am sure you all recog­nise in your deal­ings, whether with per­sons or things, the import­ance of your start­ing-point. It was the same with psycho-ana­lysis: the course of devel­op­ment through which it has passed, and the recep­tion which it has met with have not been unaf­fected by the fact that what it began work­ing upon was the symp­tom, a thing which is more for­eign to the ego than any­thing else in the mind. The symp­tom has its origin in the repressed, it is as it were the rep­res­ent­at­ive of the repressed in rela­tion to the ego; the repressed is a for­eign ter­rit­ory to the ego, an internal for­eign ter­rit­ory, just as real­ity is—you must excuse the unusual expres­sion—an external for­eign ter­rit­ory. From the symp­tom the path of psycho-ana­lysis led to the uncon­scious, to the life of the instincts, to sexu­al­ity, and it was then that psycho-ana­lysis was met by illu­min­at­ing cri­ti­cisms to the effect that man is not merely a sexual being but has nobler and higher feel­ings. It might have been added that, sup­por­ted by the con­scious­ness of those higher feel­ings, he often allowed him­self the right to think non­sense and to over­look facts.</p>
<p>You know better than that. From the very begin­ning our view was that men fall ill owing to the con­flict between the demands of their instincts and the internal res­ist­ance which is set up against them; not for a moment did we forget this res­ist­ing, reject­ing and repress­ing factor, which we believed to be fur­nished with its own spe­cial forces, the ego-instincts, and which cor­res­ponds to the ego of pop­u­lar psy­cho­logy. The dif­fi­culty was that, since the pro­gress of all sci­entific work is neces­sar­ily labor­i­ous, psycho-ana­lysis could not study every part of the field at once or make a pro­nounce­ment on every prob­lem in one breath. At last we had got so far that we could turn our atten­tion from the repressed to the repress­ing forces, and we came face to face with the ego, which seemed to need so little explan­a­tion, with the cer­tain expect­a­tion that there, too, we should find things for which we could not have been pre­pared; but it was not easy to find a first method of approach. That is what I am going to talk to you about to-day.</p>
<p>Before I start, I may tell you that I have a sus­pi­cion that my account of the psy­cho­logy of the ego will affect you dif­fer­ently than the intro­duc­tion into the psy­cho­lo­gical under­world that pre­ceded it. Why that should be the case, I cannot say for cer­tain. My ori­ginal explan­a­tion was that you would feel that, whereas hitherto I have been telling you in the main about facts, how­ever strange and odd they might appear, this time you would be listen­ing chiefly to the­or­ies, that is to say, spec­u­la­tions. But that is not quite true; when I weighed the matter more care­fully I was obliged to con­clude that the part played by intel­lec­tual manip­u­la­tion of the facts is not much greater in our ego-psy­cho­logy than it was in the psy­cho­logy of the neur­oses. Other explan­a­tions turned out to be equally unten­able, and I now think that the char­ac­ter of the mater­ial itself is respons­ible, and the fact that we are not accus­tomed to deal­ing with it. Anyhow I shall not be sur­prised if you are more hes­it­ant and care­ful in your judg­ment than you have been hitherto.</p>
<p>The situ­ation in which we find ourselves at the begin­ning of our invest­ig­a­tion will itself sug­gest the path we have to follow. We wish to make the ego the object of our study, our own ego. But how can we do that? The ego is the sub­ject <em>par excel­lence</em>, how can it become the object? There is no doubt, how­ever, that it can. The ego can take itself as object, it can treat itself like any other object, observe itself, cri­ti­cise itself, and do Heaven knows what besides with itself. In such a case one part of the ego stands over against the other. The ego can, then, be split; it splits when it per­forms many of its func­tions, at least for the time being. The parts can after­wards join up again. After all that is saying noth­ing new; per­haps it is only under­lin­ing more than usual some­thing that every one knows already. But on the other hand we are famil­iar with the view that patho­logy, with its mag­ni­fic­a­tion and exag­ger­a­tion, can make us aware of normal phe­nom­ena which we should oth­er­wise have missed. Where patho­logy dis­plays a breach or a cleft, under normal con­di­tions there may well be a link. If we throw a crys­tal to the ground, it breaks, but it does not break haphaz­ard; in accord­ance with the lines of cleav­age it falls into frag­ments, whose limits were already determ­ined by the struc­ture of the crys­tal, although they were invis­ible. Psychot­ics are fis­sured and splintered struc­tures such as these. We cannot deny them a meas­ure of that awe with which madmen were regarded by the peoples of ancient times. They have turned away from external real­ity, but for that very reason they know more of internal psychic real­ity and can tell us much that would oth­er­wise be inac­cess­ible to us. One group of them suffer what we call delu­sions of obser­va­tion. They com­plain to us that they suffer con­tinu­ally, and in their most intim­ate actions, from the obser­va­tion of unknown powers or per­sons, and they have hal­lu­cin­a­tions in which they hear these per­sons announ­cing the res­ults of their obser­va­tions: ‘now he is going to say this, now he is dress­ing him­self to go out,’ and so on. Such obser­va­tion is not the same thing as per­se­cu­tion, but it is not far removed from it. It implies that these per­sons dis­trust the patient, and expect to catch him doing some­thing that is for­bid­den and for which he will be pun­ished. How would it be if these mad people were right, if we all of us had an observing func­tion in our egos threat­en­ing us with pun­ish­ment, which, in their case, had merely become sharply sep­ar­ated from the ego and had been mis­takenly pro­jec­ted into external real­ity?</p>
<p>I do not know whether it will appeal to you in the same way as it appeals to me. Under the strong impres­sion of this clin­ical pic­ture, I formed the idea that the sep­ar­at­ing off of an observing func­tion from the rest of the ego might be a normal fea­ture of the ego’s struc­ture; this has never left me, and I was driven to Invest­ig­ate the fur­ther char­ac­ter­ist­ics and rela­tions of the func­tion which had been sep­ar­ated off in this way. The next step is soon taken. The actual con­tent of the delu­sion of obser­va­tion makes it prob­able that the obser­va­tion is only a first step towards con­vic­tion and pun­ish­ment, so that we may guess that another activ­ity of this func­tion must be what we call con­science. There is hardly any­thing that we sep­ar­ate off from our ego so reg­u­larly as our con­science and so easily set over against it. I feel a tempta­tion to do some­thing which prom­ises to bring me pleas­ure, but I refrain from doing it on the ground that ‘my con­science will not allow it.’ Or I allow myself to be per­suaded by the great­ness of the expect­a­tion of pleas­ure into doing some­thing against which the voice of my con­science has pro­tested, and after I have done it my con­science pun­ishes me with pain­ful reproaches, and makes me feel remorse for it. I might simply say that the func­tion which I am begin­ning to dis­tin­guish within the ego is the con­science; but it is more prudent to keep that func­tion as a sep­ar­ate entity and assume that con­science is one of its activ­it­ies, and that the self-obser­va­tion which is neces­sary as a pre­lim­in­ary to the judi­cial aspect of con­science is another. And since the pro­cess of recog­niz­ing a thing as a sep­ar­ate entity involves giving it a name of its own, I will hence­for­ward call this func­tion in the ego the ‘super-ego.’</p>
<p>At this point I am quite pre­pared for you to ask scorn­fully whether our ego-psy­cho­logy amounts to no more than taking every­day abstrac­tions lit­er­ally, mag­ni­fy­ing them, and turn­ing them from con­cepts into things—which would not be of much assist­ance. My answer to that is, that in ego-psy­cho­logy it will be dif­fi­cult to avoid what is already famil­iar, and that it is more a ques­tion of arriv­ing at new ways of look­ing at things and new group­ings of the facts than of making new dis­cov­er­ies. I will not ask you, there­fore, to aban­don your crit­ical atti­tude but merely to await fur­ther devel­op­ments. The facts of patho­logy give our efforts a back­ground for which you will look in vain in pop­u­lar psy­cho­logy. I will pro­ceed. No sooner have we got used to the idea of this super-ego, as some­thing which enjoys a cer­tain inde­pend­ence, pur­sues its own ends, and is inde­pend­ent of the ego as regards the energy at its dis­posal, than we are faced with a clin­ical pic­ture which throws into strong relief the sever­ity, and even cruelty, of this func­tion, and the vicis­situdes through which its rela­tions with the ego may pass. I refer to the con­di­tion of mel­an­cho­lia, or more accur­ately the mel­an­cholic attack, of which you must have heard often enough, even if you are not psy­chi­at­rists. In this dis­ease, about whose causes and mech­an­ism we know far too little, the most remark­able char­ac­ter­istic is the way in which the super-ego—you may call it, but in a whis­per, the con­science—treats the ego. The mel­an­cho­liac during peri­ods of health can, like any one else, be more or less severe towards him­self; but when he has a mel­an­cholic attack, his super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses, humi­li­ates, and ill-treats his unfor­tu­nate ego, threatens it with the severest pun­ish­ments, reproaches it for long for­got­ten actions which were at the time regarded quite lightly, and behaves as though it had spent the whole inter­val in amass­ing com­plaints and was only wait­ing for its present increase in strength to bring them for­ward, and to con­demn the ego on their account. The super-ego has the ego at its mercy and applies the most severe moral stand­ards to it; indeed it rep­res­ents the whole demands of mor­al­ity, and we see all at once that our moral sense of guilt is the expres­sion of the ten­sion between the ego and the super-ego. It is a very remark­able exper­i­ence to observe mor­al­ity, which was ostens­ibly con­ferred on us by God and planted deep in our hearts, func­tion­ing as a peri­od­ical phe­nomenon. For after a cer­tain number of months the whole moral fuss is at an end, the crit­ical voice of the super-ego is silent, the ego is rein­stated, and enjoys once more all the rights of man until the next attack. Indeed in many forms of the malady some­thing exactly the reverse takes place during the inter­vals; the ego finds itself in an ecstatic state of exal­ta­tion, it tri­umphs, as though the super-ego had lost all its power or had become merged with the ego, and this lib­er­ated, maniac ego gives itself up in a really unin­hib­ited fash­ion, to the sat­is­fac­tion of all its desires. Hap­pen­ings rich in unsolved riddles!</p>
<p>You will expect me to do more than give a mere example in sup­port of my state­ment that we have learnt a great deal about the form­a­tion of the super-ego, that is of the origin of con­science. The philo­sopher Kant once declared that noth­ing proved to him the great­ness of God more con­vin­cingly than the starry heav­ens and the moral con­science within us. The stars are unques­tion­ably superb, but where con­science is con­cerned God has been guilty of an uneven and care­less piece of work, for a great many men have only a lim­ited share of it or scarcely enough to be worth men­tion­ing. This does not mean, how­ever, that we are over­look­ing the frag­ment of psy­cho­lo­gical truth which is con­tained in the asser­tion that con­science is of divine origin! but the asser­tion needs inter­pret­a­tion. Con­science is no doubt some­thing within us, but it has not been there from the begin­ning. In this sense it is the oppos­ite of sexu­al­ity, which is cer­tainly present from the very begin­ning of life, and is not a thing that only comes in later. But small chil­dren are notori­ously a-moral. They have no internal inhib­i­tions against their pleas­ure-seek­ing impulses. The role, which the super-ego under­takes later in life, is at first played by an external power, by par­ental author­ity. The influ­ence of the par­ents dom­in­ates the child by grant­ing proofs of affec­tion and by threats of pun­ish­ment, which, to the child, mean loss of love, and which must also be feared on their own account. This object­ive anxi­ety is the fore­run­ner of the later moral anxi­ety; so long as the former is dom­in­ant one need not speak of super-ego or of con­science. It is only later that the sec­ond­ary situ­ation arises, which we are far too ready to regard as the normal state of affairs; the external restric­tions are intro­jec­ted, so that the super-ego takes the place of the par­ental func­tion, and thence­for­ward observes, guides and threatens the ego in just the same way as the par­ents acted to the child before.</p>
<p>The super-ego, which in this way has taken over the power, the aims and even the meth­ods of the par­ental func­tion, is, how­ever, not merely the leg­atee of par­ental author­ity, it is actu­ally the heir of its body. It pro­ceeds dir­ectly from it, and we shall soon learn in what way this comes about. First, how­ever, we must pause to con­sider a point in which they differ. The super-ego seems to have made a one-sided selec­tion, and to have chosen only the harsh­ness and sever­ity of the par­ents, their pre­vent­ive and pun­it­ive func­tions, while their loving care is not taken up and con­tin­ued by it. If the par­ents have really ruled with a rod of iron, we can easily under­stand the child devel­op­ing a severe super-ego, but, con­trary to our expect­a­tions, exper­i­ence shows that the super-ego may reflect the same relent­less harsh­ness even when the up-bring­ing has been gentle and kind, and avoided threats and pun­ish­ment as far as pos­sible. We shall return to this con­tra­dic­tion later, when we are deal­ing with the trans­mu­ta­tion of instincts in the form­a­tion of the super-ego.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you as much as I could wish about the change from the par­ental func­tion to the super-ego, partly because that pro­cess is so com­plic­ated that a descrip­tion of it does not fit into the frame­work of a set of intro­duct­ory lec­tures such as these, and partly because we ourselves do not feel that we have fully under­stood it. You will have to be sat­is­fied, there­fore, with the fol­low­ing indic­a­tions. The basis of the pro­cess is what we call an iden­ti­fic­a­tion, that is to say, that one ego becomes like another, one which res­ults in the first ego behav­ing itself in cer­tain respects in the same way as the second; it imit­ates it, and as it were takes it into itself. This iden­ti­fic­a­tion has been not inap­pro­pri­ately com­pared with the oral can­ni­bal­istic incor­por­a­tion of another person. Iden­ti­fic­a­tion is a very import­ant kind of rela­tion­ship with another person, prob­ably the most prim­it­ive, and is not to be con­fused with object-choice. One can express the dif­fer­ence between them in this way: when a boy iden­ti­fies him­self with his father, he wants to <em>be like</em> his father; when he makes him the object of his choice, he wants to <em>have</em> him, to pos­sess him; in the first case his ego is altered on the model of his father, in the second case that is not neces­sary. Iden­ti­fic­a­tion and object-choice are broadly speak­ing inde­pend­ent of each other; but one can identify one­self with a person, and alter one’s ego accord­ingly, and take the same person as one’s sexual object. It is said that this influ­en­cing of the ego by the sexual object takes place very often with women, and is char­ac­ter­istic of fem­in­in­ity. With regard to what is by far the most instruct­ive rela­tion between iden­ti­fic­a­tion and object-choice, I must have given you some inform­a­tion in my pre­vi­ous lec­tures. It can be as easily observed in chil­dren as in adults, in normal as in sick per­sons. If one has lost a love-object or has had to give it up, one often com­pensates one­self by identi­fy­ing one­self with it; one sets it up again inside one’s ego, so that in this case object-choice regresses, as it were, to iden­ti­fic­a­tion.</p>
<p>I am myself not at all sat­is­fied with this account of iden­ti­fic­a­tion, but it will suf­fice if you will grant that the estab­lish­ment of the super-ego can be described as a suc­cess­ful instance of iden­ti­fic­a­tion with the par­ental func­tion. The fact which is decis­ively in favour of this point of view is that this new cre­ation of a super­ior func­tion within the ego is extremely closely bound up with the fate of the Oed­ipus com­plex, so that the super-ego appears as the heir of that emo­tional tie, which is of such import­ance for child­hood. When the Oed­ipus com­plex passes away the child must give up the intense object-cathexes which it has formed towards its par­ents, and to com­pensate for this loss of object, its iden­ti­fic­a­tions with its par­ents, which have prob­ably long been present, become greatly intens­i­fied. Iden­ti­fic­a­tions of this kind, which may be looked on as pre­cip­it­ates of aban­doned object-cathexes, will recur often enough in the later life of the child; but it is in keep­ing with the emo­tional import­ance of this first instance of such a trans­form­a­tion that its product should occupy a spe­cial pos­i­tion in the ego. Fur­ther invest­ig­a­tion also reveals that the super-ego does not attain to full strength and devel­op­ment if the over­com­ing of the Oed­ipus com­plex has not been com­pletely suc­cess­ful. During the course of its growth, the super-ego also takes over the influ­ence of those per­sons who have taken the place of the par­ents, that is to say of per­sons who have been con­cerned in the child’s upbring­ing, and whom it has regarded as ideal models. Nor­mally the super-ego is con­stantly becom­ing more and more remote from the ori­ginal par­ents, becom­ing, as it were, more imper­sonal. Another thing that we must not forget is that the child values its par­ents dif­fer­ently at dif­fer­ent peri­ods of its life. At the time at which the Oed­ipus com­plex makes way for the super-ego, they seem to be splen­did fig­ures, but later on they lose a good deal of their prestige. Iden­ti­fic­a­tions take place with these later edi­tions of the par­ents as well, and reg­u­larly provide import­ant con­tri­bu­tions to the form­a­tion of char­ac­ter; but these only affect the ego, they have no influ­ence on the super-ego, which has been determ­ined by the earli­est par­ental imagos.</p>
<p>I hope you will by now feel that in pos­tu­lat­ing the exist­ence of a super-ego I have been describ­ing a genu­ine struc­tural entity, and have not been merely per­son­i­fy­ing an abstrac­tion, such as con­science. We have now to men­tion another import­ant activ­ity which is to be ascribed to the super-ego. It is also the vehicle of the ego-ideal, by which the ego meas­ures itself, towards which it strives, and whose demands for ever-increas­ing per­fec­tion it is always striv­ing to fulfil. No doubt this ego-ideal is a pre­cip­it­a­tion of the old idea of the par­ents, an expres­sion of the admir­a­tion which the child felt for the per­fec­tion which it at that time ascribed to them. I know you have heard a great deal about the sense of inferi­or­ity which is said to dis­tin­guish the neur­otic sub­ject. It crops up espe­cially in the pages of works that have lit­er­ary pre­ten­sions. A writer who brings in the expres­sion ‘inferi­or­ity-com­plex’ thinks he has sat­is­fied all the demands of psycho-ana­lysis and raised his work on to a higher psy­cho­lo­gical plane. As a matter of fact the phrase ‘inferi­or­ity-com­plex’ is hardly ever used in psycho-ana­lysis. It does not refer to any­thing which we regard as simple, let alone ele­ment­ary. To trace it back to the per­cep­tion in one­self of some organic dis­ab­il­ity or other, as the school of so-called Indi­vidual Psy­cho­lo­gists like to do, seems to us a short-sighted error. The sense of inferi­or­ity has a strong erotic basis. The child feels itself inferior when it per­ceives that it is not loved, and so does the adult as well. The only organ that is really regarded as inferior is the stun­ted penis—the girl’s clit­oris. But the major part of the sense of inferi­or­ity springs from the rela­tion­ship of the ego to its super-ego, and, like the sense of guilt, it is an expres­sion of the ten­sion between them. The sense of inferi­or­ity and the sense of guilt: are exceed­ingly dif­fi­cult to dis­tin­guish. Per­haps we should do better if we regarded the former as the erotic com­ple­ment to the sense of moral inferi­or­ity. We have paid but little atten­tion to such ques­tions of con­cep­tual dif­fer­en­ti­ation in psycho-ana­lysis.</p>
<p>Seeing that the inferi­or­ity-com­plex has become so pop­u­lar, I shall ven­ture to treat you to a short digres­sion. A his­tor­ical per­son­age of our own time, who is still living but who for the present has retired into the back­ground, suf­fers from the mal-devel­op­ment of a limb caused by an injury at birth. A very well-known con­tem­por­ary writer who has a pre­dilec­tion for writ­ing the bio­graph­ies of famous per­sons, has dealt with the life of the man to whom I am refer­ring. Now if one is writ­ing a bio­graphy, it is nat­ur­ally very dif­fi­cult to sup­press the urge for psy­cho­lo­gical under­stand­ing. The author has there­fore made an attempt to build up the whole devel­op­ment of his hero’s char­ac­ter on the basis of a sense of inferi­or­ity, which was caused by his phys­ical defect. While doing this he has over­looked a small but not unim­port­ant fact. It is usual for moth­ers to whom fate has given a sickly or oth­er­wise defect­ive child to try to com­pensate for this unfair han­di­cap with an extra amount of love. In the case we are speak­ing of, the proud mother behaved quite dif­fer­ently; she with­drew her love from the child on account of his dis­ab­il­ity. When the child grew up into a man of great power, he proved beyond all doubt by his beha­viour that he had never for­given his mother. If you will bear in mind the import­ance of mother-love for the mental life of the child, you will be able to make the neces­sary cor­rec­tions in the inferi­or­ity-theory of the bio­grapher.</p>
<p>But let us get back to the super-ego. We have alloc­ated to it the activ­it­ies of self-obser­va­tion, con­science, and the hold­ing up of ideals. It fol­lows from our account of its origin that it is based upon an over­whelm­ingly import­ant bio­lo­gical fact no less than upon a moment­ous psy­cho­lo­gical fact, namely the lengthy depend­ence of the human child on its par­ents and the Oed­ipus com­plex; these two facts, moreover, are closely bound up with each other. For us the super-ego is the rep­res­ent­at­ive of all moral restric­tions, the advoc­ate of the impulse towards per­fec­tion, in short it is as much as we have been able to appre­hend psy­cho­lo­gic­ally of what people call the ‘higher’ things in human life. Since it itself can be traced back to the influ­ence of par­ents, teach­ers, and so on, we shall learn more of its sig­ni­fic­ance if we turn our atten­tion to these sources. In gen­eral, par­ents and sim­ilar author­it­ies follow the dic­tates of their own super-egos in the up-bring­ing of chil­dren. Whatever terms their ego may be on with their super-ego, in the edu­ca­tion of the child they are severe and exact­ing. They have for­got­ten the dif­fi­culties of their own child­hood, and are glad to be able to identify them­selves fully at last with their own par­ents, who in their day sub­jec­ted them to such severe restraints. The result is that the super-ego of the child is not really built up on the model of the par­ents, but on that of the par­ents’ super-ego; it takes over the same con­tent, it becomes the vehicle of tra­di­tion and of all the age-long values which have been handed down in this way from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion. You may easily guess what great help is afforded by the recog­ni­tion of the super-ego in under­stand­ing the social beha­viour of man, in grasp­ing the prob­lem of delin­quency, for example, and per­haps, too, in provid­ing us with some prac­tical hints upon edu­ca­tion, It is prob­able that the so-called mater­i­al­istic con­cep­tions of his­tory err in that they under­es­tim­ate this factor. They brush it aside with the remark that the ‘ideo­lo­gies’ of man­kind are noth­ing more than res­ult­ants of their eco­nomic situ­ation at any given moment or super­struc­tures built upon it. That is the truth, but very prob­ably it is not the whole truth. Man­kind never lives com­pletely in the present; the ideo­lo­gies of the super-ego per­petu­ate the past, the tra­di­tions of the race and the people, which yield but slowly to the influ­ence of the present and to new devel­op­ments, and, so long as they work through the super-ego, play an import­ant part in man’s life, quite inde­pend­ently of eco­nomic con­di­tions.</p>
<p>In 1921 I tried to apply the dis­tinc­tion between the ego and the super-ego to the study of group psy­cho­logy. I reached a for­mula, which ran like this: A psy­cho­lo­gical group is a col­lec­tion of indi­vidu­als, who have intro­duced the same person into their super-ego, and on the basis of this common factor have iden­ti­fied them­selves with one another in their ego. This nat­ur­ally only holds for groups who have a leader. If we could find more applic­a­tions of this kind, the hypo­thesis of the super-ego would lose all its strange­ness for us, and we should be entirely relieved of the embar­rass­ment which we cannot help feel­ing when, used as we are to the atmo­sphere of the under­world, we make excur­sions into the more super­fi­cial and higher planes of the mental appar­atus. Of course we do not for a moment think that the last word on ego-psy­cho­logy has been spoken with the demarc­a­tion of the super-ego. It is rather the begin­ning of the sub­ject, but in this case it is not only the first step that is dif­fi­cult.</p>
<p>But now another task awaits us, as it were at the oppos­ite end of the ego. This ques­tion is raised by an obser­va­tion which is made during ana­lytic work, an obser­va­tion which is, indeed, an old one. As so often hap­pens, it has taken a long time for its true value to be appre­ci­ated. As you are aware, the whole of psycho-ana­lytic theory is in fact built up on the per­cep­tion of the res­ist­ance exer­ted by the patient when we try to make him con­scious of his uncon­scious. The object­ive indic­a­tion of res­ist­ance is that his asso­ci­ations stop short or wander far away from the theme that is being dis­cussed. He may also become sub­ject­ively aware of the res­ist­ance by exper­i­en­cing pain­ful feel­ings when he approaches the theme. But this last indic­a­tion may be absent. In such a case we say to the patient that we con­clude from his beha­viour that he is in a state of res­ist­ance, and he replies that he knows noth­ing about it and is only aware of a dif­fi­culty in asso­ci­at­ing. Exper­i­ence shows that we were right, but, if so, his res­ist­ance too must have been uncon­scious, just as uncon­scious as the repressed mater­ial which we were trying to bring to the sur­face. Long ago we should have asked from which part of the mind such an uncon­scious res­ist­ance could oper­ate. The begin­ner in psycho-ana­lysis will be ready at once with the answer that it must be the res­ist­ance of the uncon­scious. An ambigu­ous and use­less answer! If it means that the res­ist­ance oper­ates from the repressed, then we must say: ‘Cer­tainly not!’ To the repressed we must rather ascribe a strong upward-driv­ing force, an impul­sion to get through to con­scious­ness. The res­ist­ance can only be a mani­fest­a­tion of the ego, which car­ried through the repres­sion at one time or other and is now endeav­our­ing to keep it up. And that too was our earlier view. Now that we have pos­ited a spe­cial func­tion within the ego to rep­res­ent the demand for restric­tion and rejec­tion, <em>i.e.</em> the super-ego, we can say that repres­sion is the work of the super-ego,—either that it does its work on its own account or else that the ego does it in obed­i­ence to its orders. If now we are faced with the case where the patient under ana­lysis is not con­scious of his res­ist­ance, then it must be either that the super-ego and the ego can oper­ate uncon­sciously in quite import­ant situ­ations, or, which would be far more sig­ni­fic­ant, that parts of both ego and super-ego them­selves are uncon­scious. In both cases we should have to take account of the dis­turb­ing view that the ego (includ­ing the super-ego) does not by any means com­pletely coin­cide with the con­scious, nor the repressed with the uncon­scious.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—I feel I must have a little breath­ing space, which I expect you will wel­come with relief, and before I go on I must make an apo­logy. Here am I giving you a sup­ple­ment to the intro­duc­tion to psycho-ana­lysis which I star­ted fif­teen years ago, and I am behav­ing as though you yourselves had been doing noth­ing but psycho-ana­lysis all that time. I know it is a mon­strous sup­pos­i­tion, but I am help­less, I have no altern­at­ive. The reason is that it is exceed­ingly dif­fi­cult to give an insight into psycho-ana­lysis to any one who is not him­self a psycho-ana­lyst. I assure you that we do not like to give the effect of being mem­bers of a secret soci­ety car­ry­ing on a secret sci­ence. And yet we have been obliged to recog­nise and state as our con­sidered opin­ion that no one has a right to a say in psycho-ana­lysis unless he has been through cer­tain exper­i­ences which he can only have by being ana­lysed him­self. When I delivered my lec­tures to you fif­teen years ago I tried to let you off cer­tain spec­u­lat­ive parts of our theory, but it is with those very parts that are con­nec­ted the new dis­cov­er­ies which I am going to speak of to-day.</p>
<p>Now let me return to my theme. With regard to the two altern­at­ives—that the ego and the super-ego may them­selves be uncon­scious, or that they may merely give rise to uncon­scious effects—we have for good reas­ons decided in favour of the former. Cer­tainly, large por­tions of the ego and super-ego can remain uncon­scious, are, in fact, nor­mally uncon­scious. That means to say that the indi­vidual knows noth­ing of their con­tents and that it requires an expendit­ure of effort to make him con­scious of them. It is true, then, that ego and con­scious, repressed and uncon­scious do not coin­cide. We are forced fun­da­ment­ally to revise our atti­tude towards the prob­lem of con­scious and uncon­scious. At first we might be inclined to think very much less of the import­ance of con­scious­ness as a cri­terion, since it has proved so untrust­worthy. But if we did so, we should be wrong. It is the same with life: it is not worth much, but it is all that we have. Without the light shed by the qual­ity of con­scious­ness we should be lost in the, dark­ness of depth-psy­cho­logy. Nev­er­the­less we must try to ori­ent­ate ourselves anew.</p>
<p>What is meant by ‘con­scious,’ we need not dis­cuss; it is beyond all doubt. The oldest and best mean­ing of the word ‘uncon­scious’ is the descript­ive one; we call ‘uncon­scious’ any mental pro­cess the exist­ence of which we are obliged to assume—because, for instance, we infer it in some way from its effects—but of which we are not dir­ectly aware. We have the same rela­tion to that mental pro­cess as we have to a mental pro­cess in another person, except that it belongs to ourselves. If we want to be more accur­ate, we should modify the state­ment by saying that we call a pro­cess ‘uncon­scious’ when we have to assume that it was active <em>at a cer­tain time</em>, although <em>at that time</em> we knew noth­ing about it. This restric­tion reminds us that most con­scious pro­cesses are con­scious only for a short period; quite soon they become <em>latent</em>, though they can easily become con­scious again. We could also say that they had become uncon­scious, if we were cer­tain that they were still some­thing mental when they were in the latent con­di­tion. So far we should have learnt noth­ing, and not even have earned the right to intro­duce the notion of the uncon­scious into psy­cho­logy. But now we come across a new fact which we can already observe in the case of errors. We find that, in order to explain a slip of the tongue, for instance, we are obliged to assume that an inten­tion to say some par­tic­u­lar thing had formed itself in the mind of the person who made the slip. We can infer it with cer­tainty from the occur­rence of the speech-dis­turb­ance, but it was not able to obtain expres­sion; it was, that is to say, uncon­scious. If we sub­sequently bring the inten­tion to the speaker’s notice, he may recog­nise it as a famil­iar one, in which case it was only tem­por­ar­ily uncon­scious, or he may repu­di­ate it as for­eign to him, in which case it was per­man­ently uncon­scious. Such an obser­va­tion as this jus­ti­fies us in also regard­ing what we have called ‘latent’ as some­thing ‘uncon­scious.’ The con­sid­er­a­tion of these dynamic rela­tions puts us in a pos­i­tion to dis­tin­guish two kinds of uncon­scious: one which is trans­formed into con­scious arise, and another in the case of which such a trans­form­a­tion is dif­fi­cult, can only come about with a con­sid­er­able expendit­ure of energy, or may never occur at all. In order to avoid any ambi­gu­ity as to whether we are refer­ring to the one or the other uncon­scious, whether we are using the word in the descript­ive or dynamic sense, we make use of a legit­im­ate and simple expedi­ent. We call the uncon­scious which is only latent, and so can easily become con­scious, the ‘pre­conscious,’ and keep the name ‘uncon­scious’ for the other. We have now three terms, ‘con­scious,’ ‘pre­conscious,’ and ‘uncon­scious,’ to serve our pur­poses in describ­ing mental phe­nom­ena. Once again, from a purely descript­ive point of view, the ‘pre­conscious’ is also uncon­scious, but we do not give it that name, except when we are speak­ing loosely, or when we have to defend in gen­eral the exist­ence of uncon­scious pro­cesses in mental life.</p>
<p>You will, I hope, grant that so far things are not so bad and that the scheme is a con­veni­ent one. That is all very well; unfor­tu­nately our psycho-ana­lytic work has com­pelled us to use the word ‘uncon­scious’ in yet another, third, sense; and this may very well have given rise to con­fu­sion. Psycho-ana­lysis has impressed us very strongly with the new idea that large and import­ant regions of the mind are nor­mally removed from the know­ledge of the ego, so that the pro­cesses which occur in them must be recog­nized as uncon­scious in the true dynamic sense of the term. We have con­sequently also attrib­uted to the word ‘uncon­scious’ a topo­graph­ical or sys­tem­atic mean­ing; we have talked of <em>sys­tems</em> of the pre­conscious and of the uncon­scious, and of a con­flict between the ego and the Ucs. system; so that the word ‘uncon­scious’ has more and more been made to mean a mental province rather than a qual­ity which mental things have. At this point, the dis­cov­ery, incon­veni­ent at first sight, that parts of the ego and super-ego, too, are uncon­scious in the dynamic sense, has a facil­it­at­ing effect and enables us to remove a com­plic­a­tion. We evid­ently have no right to call that region of the mind which is neither ego nor super-ego the Ucs. system, since the char­ac­ter of uncon­scious­ness is not exclus­ive to it. Very well; we will no longer use the word ‘uncon­scious’ in the sense of a system, and to what we have hitherto called by that name we will give a better one, which will not give rise to mis­un­der­stand­ings. Bor­row­ing, at G. Grod­deck’s sug­ges­tion, a term used by Niet­z­sche, we will call it hence­for­ward the ‘id.’ This imper­sonal pro­noun seems par­tic­u­larly suited to express the essen­tial char­ac­ter of this province of the mind—the char­ac­ter of being for­eign to the ego. Super-ego, ego and id, then, are the three realms, regions or provinces into which we divide the mental appar­atus of the indi­vidual; and it is their mutual rela­tions with which we shall be con­cerned in what fol­lows.</p>
<p>But before we go on I must make a short digres­sion. I have no doubt that you are dis­sat­is­fied with the fact that the three qual­it­ies of the mind in respect to con­scious­ness and the three regions of the mental appar­atus do not fall together into three har­mo­ni­ous pairs, and that you feel that the clar­ity of our con­clu­sions is con­sequently impaired. My own view is that we ought not to deplore this fact but that we should say to ourselves that we had no right to expect any such neat arrange­ment. Let me give you an ana­logy; ana­lo­gies prove noth­ing, that is quite true, but they can make one feel more at home. Let us pic­ture a coun­try with a great vari­ety of geo­graph­ical con­fig­ur­a­tions, hills, plains and chains of lakes, and with mixed nation­al­it­ies living in it, Ger­mans, Mag­yars and Slov­aks, who, moreover, are engaged upon a number of dif­fer­ent occu­pa­tions. Now the dis­tri­bu­tion might be such that the Ger­mans lived in the hills and kept cattle, the Mag­yars on the plains and grew corn and vines, while the Slov­aks lived by the lakes and caught fish and plaited reeds. If this dis­tri­bu­tion were neat and exact it would no doubt give great sat­is­fac­tion to a Pres­id­ent Wilson; it would also be con­veni­ent for giving a geo­graphy lesson. It is prob­able, how­ever, that you would find a less orderly state of affairs if you vis­ited the region. Ger­mans, Mag­yars and Slov­aks would be living every­where mixed up together, and there would be corn­fields too in the hills, and cattle would be kept on the plains as well. One or two things would be as you expec­ted, for one cannot catch fish on the moun­tains, and wine does not grow in water. The pic­ture of the region which you had brought with you might on the whole fit the facts, but in details you would have to put up with depar­tures from it.</p>
<p>You must not expect me to tell you much that is new about the id, except its name. It is the obscure inac­cess­ible part of our per­son­al­ity; the little we know about it we have learnt from the study of dream-work and the form­a­tion of neur­otic symp­toms, and most of that is of a neg­at­ive char­ac­ter, and can only be described as being all that the ego is not. We can come nearer to the id with images, and call it a chaos, a cauldron of seeth­ing excite­ment. We sup­pose that it is some­where in direct con­tact with somatic pro­cesses, and takes over from them instinctual needs and gives them mental expres­sion, but we cannot say in what sub­stratum this con­tact is made. These instincts fill it with energy, but it has no organ­isa­tion and no uni­fied will, only an impul­sion to obtain sat­is­fac­tion for the instinctual needs, in accord­ance with the pleas­ure-prin­ciple. The laws of logic—above all, the law of con­tra­dic­tion—do not hold for pro­cesses in the id. Con­tra­dict­ory impulses exist side by side without neut­ral­ising each other or draw­ing apart; at most they com­bine in com­prom­ise form­a­tions under the over­power­ing eco­nomic pres­sure towards dis­char­ging their energy. There is noth­ing in the id which can be com­pared to neg­a­tion, and we are aston­ished to find in it an excep­tion to the philo­soph­ers’ asser­tion that space and time are neces­sary forms of our mental acts. In the id there is noth­ing cor­res­pond­ing to the idea of time, no recog­ni­tion of the pas­sage of time, and (a thing which is very remark­able and awaits adequate atten­tion in philo­sophic thought) no alter­a­tion of mental pro­cesses by the pas­sage of time. Con­at­ive impulses which have never got beyond the id, and even impres­sions which have been pushed down into the id by repres­sion, are vir­tu­ally immor­tal and are pre­served for whole dec­ades as though they had only recently occurred. They can only be recog­nised as belong­ing to the past, deprived of their sig­ni­fic­ance, and robbed of their charge of energy, after they have been made con­scious by the work of ana­lysis, and no small part of the thera­peutic effect of ana­lytic treat­ment rests upon this fact. It is con­stantly being borne in upon me that we have made far too little use of our theory of the indubit­able fact that the repressed remains unaltered by the pas­sage of time. This seems to offer us the pos­sib­il­ity of an approach to some really pro­found truths. But I myself have made no fur­ther pro­gress here.</p>
<p>Nat­ur­ally, the id knows no values, no good and evil, no mor­al­ity. The eco­nomic, or, if you prefer, the quant­it­at­ive factor, which is so closely bound up with the pleas­ure-prin­ciple, dom­in­ates all its pro­cesses. Instinctual cathexes seek­ing dis­charge,—that, in our view, is all that the id con­tains. It seems, indeed, as if the energy of these instinctual impulses is in a dif­fer­ent con­di­tion from that in which it is found in the other regions of the mind. It must be far more fluid and more cap­able of being dis­charged, for oth­er­wise we should not have those dis­place­ments and con­dens­a­tions, which are so char­ac­ter­istic of the id and which are so com­pletely inde­pend­ent of the qual­it­ies of what is cathec­ted. (In the ego we should call it an idea.) What would one not give to under­stand these things better? You observe, in any case, that we can attrib­ute to the id other char­ac­ter­ist­ics than that of being uncon­scious, and you are aware of the pos­sib­il­ity that parts of the ego and super-ego are uncon­scious without pos­sess­ing the same prim­it­ive and irra­tional qual­ity. As regards a char­ac­ter­isa­tion of the ego, in so far as it is to be dis­tin­guished from the id and the super-ego, we shall get on better if we turn our atten­tion to the rela­tion between it and the most super­fi­cial por­tion of the mental appar­atus; which we call the Pcpt-cs (per­cep­tual-con­scious) system. This system is dir­ec­ted on to the external world, it medi­ates per­cep­tions of it, and in it is gen­er­ated, while it is func­tion­ing, the phe­nomenon of con­scious­ness. It is the sense-organ of the whole appar­atus, recept­ive, moreover, not only of excit­a­tions from without but also of such as pro­ceed from the interior of the mind. One can hardly go wrong in regard­ing the ego as that part of the id which has been mod­i­fied by its prox­im­ity to the external world and the influ­ence that the latter has had on it, and which serves the pur­pose of receiv­ing stim­uli and pro­tect­ing the organ­ism from them, like the cor­tical layer with which a particle of living sub­stance sur­rounds itself. This rela­tion to the external world is decis­ive for the ego. The ego has taken over the task of rep­res­ent­ing the external world for the id, and so of saving it; for the id, blindly striv­ing to grat­ify its instincts in com­plete dis­reg­ard of the super­ior strength of out­side forces, could not oth­er­wise escape anni­hil­a­tion. In the ful­fil­ment of this func­tion, the ego has to observe the external world and pre­serve a true pic­ture of it in the memory traces left by its per­cep­tions, and, by means of the real­ity-test, it has to elim­in­ate any ele­ment in this pic­ture of the external world which is a con­tri­bu­tion from internal sources of excit­a­tion. On behalf of the id, the ego con­trols the path of access to motil­ity, but it inter­pol­ates between desire and action the pro­cras­tin­at­ing factor of thought, during which it makes use of the residues of exper­i­ence stored up in memory. In this way it dethrones the pleas­ure-prin­ciple, which exerts undis­puted sway over the pro­cesses in the id, and sub­sti­tutes for it the real­ity-prin­ciple, which prom­ises greater secur­ity and greater suc­cess.</p>
<p>The rela­tion to time, too, which is so hard to describe, is com­mu­nic­ated to the ego by the per­cep­tual system; indeed it can hardly be doubted that the mode in which this system works is the source of the idea of time. What, how­ever, espe­cially marks the ego out in con­tra­dis­tinc­tion to the id, is a tend­ency to syn­thes­ise its con­tents, to bring together and unify its mental pro­cesses which is entirely absent from the id. When we come to deal presently with the instincts in mental life, I hope we shall suc­ceed in tra­cing this fun­da­mental char­ac­ter­istic of the ego to its source. It is this alone that pro­duces that high degree of organ­isa­tion which the ego needs for its highest achieve­ments. The ego advances from the func­tion of per­ceiv­ing instincts to that of con­trolling them, but the latter is only achieved through the mental rep­res­ent­at­ive of the instinct becom­ing sub­or­din­ated to a larger organ­isa­tion, and find­ing its place in a coher­ent unity. In pop­u­lar lan­guage, we may say that the ego stands for reason and cir­cum­spec­tion, while the id stands for the untamed pas­sions.</p>
<p>So far we have allowed ourselves to dwell on the enu­mer­a­tion of the merits and cap­ab­il­it­ies of the ego; it is time now to look at the other side of the pic­ture. The ego is after all only a part of the id, a part pur­pos­ively mod­i­fied by its prox­im­ity to the dangers of real­ity. From a dynamic point of view it is weak; it bor­rows its energy from the id, and we are not entirely ignor­ant of the meth­ods—one might almost call them ‘tricks’—by means of which it draws fur­ther amounts of energy from the id. Such a method, for example, is the pro­cess of iden­ti­fic­a­tion, whether the object is retained or given up. The object-cathexes pro­ceed from the instinctual demands of the id. The first busi­ness of the ego is to take note of them. But by identi­fy­ing itself with the object, it recom­mends itself to the id in the place of the object and seeks to attract the libido of the id on to itself. We have already seen that, in the course of a person’s life, the ego takes into itself a large number of such pre­cip­it­ates of former object-cathexes. On the whole the ego has to carry out the inten­tions of the id; it ful­fils its duty if it suc­ceeds in cre­at­ing the con­di­tions under which these inten­tions can best be ful­filled. One might com­pare the rela­tion of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the loco­mot­ive energy, and the rider has the prerog­at­ive of determ­in­ing the goal and of guid­ing the move­ments of his power­ful mount towards it. But all too often in the rela­tions between the ego and the id we find a pic­ture of the less ideal situ­ation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the dir­ec­tion in which it itself wants to go.</p>
<p>The ego has sep­ar­ated itself off from one part of the id by means of repres­sion-res­ist­ances. But the bar­rier of repres­sion does not extend into the id; so that the repressed mater­ial merges into the rest of the id.</p>
<p>The pro­verb tells us that one cannot serve two mas­ters at once. The poor ego has a still harder time of it; it has to serve three harsh mas­ters, and has to do its best to recon­cile the claims and demands of all three. These demands are always diver­gent and often seem quite incom­pat­ible; no wonder that the ego so fre­quently gives way under its task. The three tyr­ants are the external world, the super-ego and the id. When one watches the efforts of the ego to sat­isfy them all, or rather, to obey them all sim­ul­tan­eously, one cannot regret having per­son­i­fied the ego, and estab­lished it as a sep­ar­ate being. It feels itself hemmed in on three sides and threatened by three kinds of danger, towards which it reacts by devel­op­ing anxi­ety when it is too hard pressed. Having ori­gin­ated in the exper­i­ences of the per­cep­tual system, it is designed to rep­res­ent the demands of the external world, but it also wishes to be a loyal ser­vant of the id, to remain upon good terms with the id, to recom­mend itself to the id as an object, and to draw the id’s libido on to itself. In its attempt to medi­ate between the id and real­ity, it is often forced to clothe the Ucs. com­mands of the id with its own Pcs. ration­al­isa­tions, to gloss over the con­flicts between the id and real­ity, and with dip­lo­matic dis­hon­esty to dis­play a pre­ten­ded regard for real­ity, even when the id per­sists in being stub­born and uncom­prom­ising. On the other hand, its every move­ment is watched by the severe super-ego, which holds up cer­tain norms of beha­viour, without regard to any dif­fi­culties coming from the id and the external world; and if these norms are not acted up to, it pun­ishes the ego with the feel­ings of ten­sion which mani­fest them­selves as a sense of inferi­or­ity and guilt. In this way, goaded on by the id, in by the super-ego, and rebuffed by real­ity, the ego struggles to cope with its eco­nomic task of redu­cing the forces and influ­ences which work in it and upon it to some kind of har­mony; and we may well under­stand how it is that we so often cannot repress the cry: ‘Life is not easy.’ When the ego is forced to acknow­ledge its weak­ness, it breaks out into anxi­ety: real­ity anxi­ety in face of the external world, normal anxi­ety in face of the super ego, and neur­otic anxi­ety in face of the strength of the pas­sions in the id.</p>
<p>I have rep­res­en­ted the struc­tural rela­tions within the mental per­son­al­ity, as I have explained them to you, in a simple dia­gram, which I here repro­duce.</p>
<p>You will observe how the super-ego goes down into the id; as the heir to the Oed­ipus com­plex it has, after all, intim­ate con­nec­tions with the id. It lies fur­ther from the per­cep­tual system than the ego. The id only deals with the external world through the medium of the ego, at least in this dia­gram. It is cer­tainly still too early to say how far the draw­ing is cor­rect; in one respect I know it is not. The space taken up by the uncon­scious id ought to be incom­par­ably greater than that given to the ego or to the pre­conscious. You must, if you please, cor­rect that in your ima­gin­a­tion.</p>
<p>And now, in con­clud­ing this cer­tainly rather exhaust­ing and per­haps not very illu­min­at­ing account, I must add a warn­ing. When you think of this divid­ing up of the per­son­al­ity into ego, super-ego and id, you must not ima­gine sharp divid­ing lines such as are arti­fi­cially drawn in the field of polit­ical geo­graphy. We cannot do justice to the char­ac­ter­ist­ics of the mind by means of linear con­tours, such as occur in a draw­ing or in a prim­it­ive paint­ing, but we need rather the areas of colour shad­ing off into one another that are to be found in modern pic­tures. After we have made our sep­ar­a­tions, we must allow what we have sep­ar­ated to merge again. Do not judge too harshly of a first attempt at pic­tur­ing a thing so elu­sive as the human mind. It is very prob­able that the extent of these dif­fer­en­ti­ations varies very greatly from person to person; it is pos­sible that their func­tion itself may vary, and that they may at times undergo a pro­cess of invol­u­tion. This seems to be par­tic­u­larly true of the most insec­ure and, from the phylo­gen­etic point of view, the most recent of them, the dif­fer­en­ti­ation between the ego and the super-ego.</p>
<p><img src="figures/figure-1.png" /></p>
<p>It is also incon­test­able that the same thing can come about as a result of mental dis­ease. It can easily be ima­gined, too, that cer­tain prac­tices of mys­tics may suc­ceed in upset­ting the normal rela­tions between the dif­fer­ent regions of the mind, so that, for example, the per­cep­tual system becomes able to grasp rela­tions in the deeper layers of the ego and in the id which would oth­er­wise be inac­cess­ible to it. Whether such a pro­ced­ure can put one in pos­ses­sion of ulti­mate truths, from which all good will flow, may be safely doubted. All the same, we must admit that the thera­peutic efforts of psycho-ana­lysis have chosen much the same method of approach. For their object is to strengthen the ego, to make it more inde­pend­ent of the super-ego, to widen its field of vision, and so to extend its organ­isa­tion that it can take over new por­tions of the id. Where id was, there shall ego be.</p>
<p>It is reclam­a­tion work, like the drain­ing of the Zuyder Zee.</p>

<h2>Anxi­ety And Instinctual Life, Lec­ture XXXII</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—You will not be sur­prised to hear that I have a great deal of new inform­a­tion to give you about our hypo­theses on the sub­ject of anxi­ety and the fun­da­mental instincts of the mind, and also that none of this inform­a­tion claims to provide a final solu­tion of these doubt­ful prob­lems. I speak pur­posely of ‘hypo­theses.’ This is the most dif­fi­cult task that has been set us, but the dif­fi­culty does not lie in the incom­plete­ness of our obser­va­tions, for it is actu­ally the com­mon­est and most famil­iar phe­nom­ena that present us with such riddles; nor does it lie in the remote­ness of the spec­u­la­tions to which these phe­nom­ena give rise, for spec­u­la­tion hardly comes into the pic­ture in this con­nec­tion. No, it is genu­inely a ques­tion of hypo­theses; that is to say, of the intro­duc­tion of the right abstract ideas, and of their applic­a­tion to the raw mater­ial of obser­va­tion so as to bring order and lucid­ity into it.</p>
<p>I devoted one lec­ture in my former series—the twenty-fifth—to the study of anxi­ety. I must recapit­u­late its con­tents in brief. We said then that anxi­ety is an affect­ive con­di­tion—that is to say, a com­bin­a­tion of cer­tain feel­ings of the pleas­ure-pain series with their cor­res­pond­ing effer­ent innerv­a­tions, and a per­cep­tion of them—but we asser­ted that anxi­ety is prob­ably also the trace of a cer­tain import­ant event, taken over by inher­it­ance, and there­fore com­par­able to the onto­gen­et­ic­ally acquired hys­ter­ical attack. We sug­ges­ted that the event which left this affect­ive trace behind it was the pro­cess of birth, in which the modi­fic­a­tions of the heart’s action and of res­pir­a­tion, which are char­ac­ter­istic of anxi­ety, served a useful pur­pose. The first anxi­ety of all would thus have been a toxic one. We then star­ted from the dis­tinc­tion between object­ive anxi­ety and neur­otic anxi­ety, the former being what seems to us an intel­li­gible reac­tion to danger—that is, to anti­cip­ated injury from without—and the latter alto­gether puzz­ling and, as it were, pur­pose­less. In our ana­lysis of object­ive anxi­ety we explained it as a con­di­tion of increased sens­ory atten­tion and motor ten­sion, which we called ‘<em>anxi­ety-pre­pared­ness</em>’ Out of this the anxi­ety-reac­tion arises. The anxi­ety-reac­tion may run one of two courses. Either the <em>anxi­ety-devel­op­ment</em>, the repe­ti­tion of the old trau­matic exper­i­ence, is restric­ted to a signal, in which case the rest of the reac­tion can adapt itself to the new situ­ation of danger, whether by flight or defence; or the old exper­i­ence gets the upper hand, and the whole reac­tion exhausts itself in anxi­ety-devel­op­ment, in which case the affect­ive state is para­lys­ing and unadap­ted to the present situ­ation.</p>
<p>We then turned our atten­tion to neur­otic anxi­ety, and poin­ted out that it could be observed in three forms. Firstly, we have free-float­ing, gen­eral appre­hens­ive­ness, ready to attach itself for the time being to any new pos­sib­il­ity that may arise in the form of what we call expect­ant dread, as hap­pens, for instance, in the typ­ical anxi­ety-neur­osis. Secondly, we find it firmly attached to cer­tain ideas, in what are known as <em>pho­bias</em>, in which we can still recog­nise a con­nec­tion with external danger, but cannot help regard­ing the anxi­ety felt towards it as enorm­ously exag­ger­ated. Thirdly and finally, we have anxi­ety as it occurs in hys­teria and in other severe neur­oses; this anxi­ety either accom­pan­ies symp­toms or mani­fests itself inde­pend­ently, whether as an attack or as a con­di­tion which per­sists for some time, but always without having any vis­ible jus­ti­fic­a­tion in an external danger. We then asked ourselves two ques­tions: ‘What are people afraid of when they have neur­otic anxi­ety?’ and ‘How can one bring this kind of anxi­ety into line with object­ive anxi­ety felt towards an external danger?’</p>
<p>Our invest­ig­a­tions were by no means unsuc­cess­ful, and we suc­ceeded in reach­ing a few import­ant con­clu­sions. With regard to anxious expect­a­tion, clin­ical exper­i­ence has taught us that there is a reg­u­lar rela­tion­ship between it and the dis­pos­i­tion of the libido in the sexual life. The most fre­quent cause of anxi­ety-neur­osis is undis­charged excit­a­tion. A libid­inal excit­a­tion is aroused, but is not sat­is­fied or used; in the place of this libido which has been diver­ted from its use, anxi­ety makes its appear­ance. I even thought it was jus­ti­fi­able to say that this unsat­is­fied libido is dir­ectly trans­formed into anxi­ety. This view found some sup­port in cer­tain almost uni­ver­sal pho­bias of small chil­dren. Many of these pho­bias are alto­gether enig­matic, but others, such as the fear of being left alone and the fear of unfa­mil­iar people, can be def­in­itely explained. Being left alone or seeing strange faces stirs up the child’s long­ing for the famil­iar pres­ence of its mother; it cannot con­trol this libid­inal excit­a­tion; it cannot keep it in a state of sus­pen­sion, but turns it into anxi­ety. This anxi­ety in chil­dren, there­fore, is not object­ive anxi­ety, but must be classed among the neur­otic anxi­et­ies. Chil­dren’s pho­bias, and the anxious expect­a­tion in anxi­ety-neur­osis, serve as two examples of one way in which neur­otic anxi­ety comes about; <em>i.e.</em> through direct trans­form­a­tion of libido. In a moment we shall learn of a second method, and we shall see that it is not so very dif­fer­ent from the first.</p>
<p>For it is to the pro­cess of repres­sion that we attrib­ute the appear­ance of anxi­ety in hys­teria and other neur­oses. We now believe that it is pos­sible to give a fuller descrip­tion of this pro­cess than before if we sep­ar­ate the his­tory of the idea that has to be repressed from that of the libido which is attached to it. It is the idea that under­goes repres­sion and may be dis­tor­ted so as to become unre­cog­niz­able; its asso­ci­ated affect is always turned into anxi­ety, regard­less of its nature, whether, that is to say, it is aggres­sion or love. Now it makes no essen­tial dif­fer­ence on what grounds a given quant­ity of libido has become unus­able, whether on account of the infant­ile weak­ness of the ego, as in the case of chil­dren’s pho­bias, or on account of somatic pro­cesses in sexual life, as in the case of anxi­ety neur­oses, or on account of repres­sion, as in the case of hys­teria. The two mech­an­isms which give rise to neur­otic anxi­ety are there­fore essen­tially the same.</p>
<p>While we were engaged in these invest­ig­a­tions, we noticed a very import­ant con­nec­tion between anxi­ety-devel­op­ment and symp­tom-form­a­tion. It was that the two are inter­change­able. The agora­pho­biac, for example, begins his ill­ness with an attack of anxi­ety in the street. This is repeated every time he walks along the street again. He now devel­ops a symp­tom—a street phobia—which can also be described as an inhib­i­tion or a func­tional restric­tion of the ego, and thus he pre­serves him­self from anxi­ety attacks. One can observe the reverse pro­cess if one inter­feres with the form­a­tion of symp­toms, as is pos­sible, for instance, in the case of obsess­ive acts. If one pre­vents a patient from car­ry­ing out his wash­ing cere­mo­nial, he is thrown into an intol­er­able state of anxi­ety, against which his symp­tom has obvi­ously pro­tec­ted him. And, indeed, it seems as though anxi­ety-devel­op­ment is the earlier and symp­tom-form­a­tion the later of the two, as though the symp­tom were cre­ated in order to pre­vent the out­break of a state of anxi­ety. And it is in keep­ing with this that the first neur­oses of child­hood are pho­bias—con­di­tions, that is to say, in which one sees quite clearly how what began as anxi­ety-devel­op­ment is later replaced by symp­tom-form­a­tion: one gets an impres­sion that this cir­cum­stance affords the best start­ing-point from which to approach an under­stand­ing of neur­otic anxi­ety. At the same time we suc­ceeded in dis­cov­er­ing the answer to the ques­tion of what it is that one fears in neur­otic anxi­ety, and thus restor­ing the con­nec­tion between neur­otic anxi­ety and object­ive anxi­ety. What one fears is obvi­ously one’s own libido. The dif­fer­ence between this and object­ive anxi­ety lies in two points—that the danger is an internal instead of an external one, and that it is not con­sciously recog­nised.</p>
<p>In the case of pho­bias one can see clearly how this internal danger is trans­formed into an external one; how, that is to say, neur­otic anxi­ety turns into appar­ent object­ive anxi­ety. Let us sim­plify a state of affairs which is often very com­plic­ated, and sup­pose that the agora­pho­biac is always afraid of his impulses in con­nec­tion with tempta­tions aroused in him by meet­ing people in the street. In his phobia he makes a dis­place­ment and is now afraid of an external situ­ation. What he gains thereby is obvi­ous; it is that he feels he can pro­tect him­self better in that way. One can rescue one­self from an external danger by flight, whereas to attempt to fly from an internal danger is a dif­fi­cult under­tak­ing.</p>
<p>At the end of my ori­ginal lec­ture on anxi­ety I expressed the opin­ion that, though these vari­ous res­ults of our invest­ig­a­tions did not actu­ally con­tra­dict one another, they were nev­er­the­less not entirely con­sist­ent. As an affect­ive con­di­tion, anxi­ety is the repro­duc­tion of an old danger-threat­en­ing event; anxi­ety serves the pur­poses of self-pre­ser­va­tion as being a signal of the pres­ence of a new danger; it arises from libido that has become unus­able for some reason or other, includ­ing the pro­cess of repres­sion; it is replaced by symp­tom-form­a­tion, and is thus, as it were, psych­ic­ally bound; in all of this one feels that some­thing is miss­ing which would com­bine these frag­ments into a unity.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—The divi­sion of the mental per­son­al­ity into a super-ego, ego and id, which I spoke about in the last lec­ture, has forced us to take up a new pos­i­tion with regard to the prob­lem of anxi­ety. In assum­ing that the ego is the only seat of anxi­ety, and that only the ego can pro­duce and feel anxi­ety, we have taken up a new and secure pos­i­tion, from which many facts take on a new aspect. And when you come to think of it, it is dif­fi­cult to see what sense there could be in speak­ing of an ‘anxi­ety of the id,’ or how we could ascribe a capa­city for feel­ing anxi­ety to the super-ego. On the con­trary, we have found a sat­is­fact­ory con­firm­a­tion of our theory in the fact that the three main vari­et­ies of anxi­ety—object­ive anxi­ety, neur­otic anxi­ety and moral anxi­ety—can so easily be related to the three dir­ec­tions in which the ego is depend­ent, on the external world, on the id and on the super-ego. Our new pos­i­tion, too, has brought to the fore the func­tion of anxi­ety as a signal indic­at­ing the pres­ence of a danger-situ­ation, a func­tion with which we were already not unfa­mil­iar. The ques­tion of the stuff out of which anxi­ety is made loses interest for us, and the rela­tions between object­ive anxi­ety and neur­otic anxi­ety are cla­ri­fied and sim­pli­fied in a sur­pris­ing way. And, besides this, it is to be noticed that we now under­stand the appar­ently com­plic­ated cases of anxi­ety-form­a­tion better than we do those which seem to be simple.</p>
<p>We have recently invest­ig­ated the manner in which anxi­ety comes about in cer­tain pho­bias, which we class with anxi­ety-hys­teria, and we have chosen for invest­ig­a­tion cases in which we have to deal with the typ­ical repres­sion of desires pro­ceed­ing from the Oed­ipus com­plex. We should have expec­ted to find that it is the libid­inal cathexis of the mother as object which, as a result of repres­sion, is trans­formed into anxi­ety, and now mani­fests itself in the form of a symp­tom as attached to the father-sub­sti­tute. I cannot tell you all the indi­vidual steps of an invest­ig­a­tion of this kind; let it suf­fice to say that, to our aston­ish­ment, the result was the reverse of what we had expec­ted. It is not the repres­sion that cre­ates the anxi­ety, but the anxi­ety is there first and cre­ates the repres­sion! But what sort of anxi­ety can it be? It can only be fear of a threat­en­ing external danger; that is to say, object­ive anxi­ety. It is true that the boy is afraid of the demands of his libido, in this case of his love for his mother; so that this is really an instance of neur­otic anxi­ety. But this being in love seems to him to be an internal danger, which he must avoid by renoun­cing his object, only because it involves an external danger-situ­ation. And in every case we have invest­ig­ated we have obtained the same result. It must, how­ever, be con­fessed that we were not pre­pared to find that the internal instinctual danger was only a half-way house to an external and real danger-situ­ation.</p>
<p>We have, how­ever, not yet said what the real danger is that the child fears as a result of his being in love with his mother. It is the pun­ish­ment of cas­tra­tion, the loss of his penis. Nat­ur­ally you will object that after all that is not a real danger. Our boys are not cas­trated because they are in love with their moth­ers during the phase of the Oed­ipus-com­plex. But the ques­tion cannot be so easily dis­missed. It is not primar­ily a matter of whether cas­tra­tion is really per­formed; what is import­ant is that the danger is one that threatens from without, and that the boy believes in it. He has some grounds for doing so, for, not infre­quently, threats of his penis being cut off are made during his phal­lic phase, at the time of his early mas­turb­a­tion; and no doubt allu­sions to such a pun­ish­ment will always find a phylo­gen­etic rein­force­ment on his side. We have con­jec­tured that, in the early days of the human family, cas­tra­tion really was per­formed on the grow­ing boy by the jeal­ous and cruel father, and that cir­cum­cision, which is so fre­quently an ele­ment in puberty rites, is an easily recog­nis­able trace of it. We are aware of how far removed we are from the common point of view in saying this, but we must main­tain our pos­i­tion that fear of cas­tra­tion is one of the most fre­quent and one of the strongest motive forces of repres­sion, and there­fore of the form­a­tion of neur­oses. The ana­lysis of cases in which, not, it is true, cas­tra­tion itself, but cir­cum­cision, has been per­formed on boys as a cure or as a pun­ish­ment for mas­turb­a­tion (a thing which was by no means of rare occur­rence in Eng­lish and Amer­ican soci­ety) has provided us with con­clus­ive proof that we are right. It is a great tempta­tion at this junc­ture to go fur­ther into the cas­tra­tion-com­plex, but we will keep to our sub­ject. Fear of cas­tra­tion is nat­ur­ally not the only motive for repres­sion; to start with, it has no place in the psy­cho­logy of women; they have, of course, a cas­tra­tion-com­plex, but they cannot have any fear of cas­tra­tion. In its place, for the other sex, is found fear of the loss of love, obvi­ously a con­tinu­ation of the fear of the infant at the breast when it misses its mother. You will under­stand what object­ive danger-situ­ation is indic­ated by this kind of anxi­ety. If the mother is absent or has with­drawn her love from the child, it can no longer be cer­tain that its needs will be sat­is­fied, and may be exposed to the most pain­ful feel­ings of ten­sion. There is no need to reject the idea that these con­di­tions for anxi­ety fun­da­ment­ally repeat the situ­ation of the ori­ginal birth-anxi­ety, which, to be sure, also implied sep­ar­a­tion from the mother. Indeed, if you follow a line of thought sug­ges­ted by Fer­enczi, you may add fear of cas­tra­tion, too, to this series, for the loss of the male gen­ital organ res­ults in the impossib­il­ity of a reunion with the mother, or with a sub­sti­tute for her, in the sexual act. I might men­tion, incid­ent­ally, that the common phant­asy of return­ing into the womb is a sub­sti­tute for this desire for coitus. There are still a great number of inter­est­ing and sur­pris­ing facts which I might tell you about in this con­nec­tion; but I must not step beyond the bounds of an intro­duc­tion to psycho-ana­lysis. I will there­fore merely draw your atten­tion to the way in which, at this point, the find­ings of psy­cho­logy take us to the fron­ti­ers of bio­lo­gical fact.</p>
<p>Otto Rank, to whom psycho-ana­lysis owes many valu­able con­tri­bu­tions, has also the merit of having strongly emphas­ised the import­ance of the act of birth and of sep­ar­a­tion from the mother. It is true that the rest of us found it impossible to accept the extreme deduc­tions that he drew from this factor with regard to the theory of the neur­oses and even to ana­lyt­ical ther­apy. But before this he had already dis­covered the cent­ral fea­ture of his doc­trine, namely, that the anxi­ety-exper­i­ence of birth is the pro­to­type of all later danger-situ­ations. If we pause for a moment at this point we can say that, as a matter of fact, every stage of devel­op­ment has its own par­tic­u­lar con­di­tions for anxi­ety; that is to say, a danger-situ­ation appro­pri­ate to it. The danger of mental help­less­ness cor­res­ponds to the stage of early imma­tur­ity of the ego; the danger of loss of object or of love cor­res­ponds to the depend­ence of the early years of child­hood; the danger of cas­tra­tion to the phal­lic phase; and finally, fear of the super-ego, which occu­pies a spe­cial pos­i­tion, to the period of latency. As devel­op­ment pro­ceeds, the old con­di­tions for anxi­ety should vanish, since the danger-situ­ations, which cor­res­pond to them, have lost their force owing to the strength­en­ing of the ego. But this only hap­pens to a very incom­plete degree. A great many people cannot over­come the fear of loss of love; they never become inde­pend­ent enough of the love of other people, and con­tinue their infant­ile beha­viour in this respect. The fear of the super-ego should nor­mally never cease, since it is indis­pens­able in social rela­tions in the form of moral anxi­ety, and it is only in the rarest instances that an indi­vidual suc­ceeds in becom­ing inde­pend­ent of the com­munity. A few of the old danger-situ­ations also manage to pre­serve their force in later life by giving their con­di­tions for anxi­ety an up-to-date form. Thus, for instance, the danger of cas­tra­tion is pre­served under the dis­guise of syph­ilido­pho­bia. Grown-up people are well aware that cas­tra­tion is no longer prac­tised as a pun­ish­ment for indul­ging sexual desires, but, on the other hand, they have learnt from exper­i­ence that instinctual free­dom in this dir­ec­tion involves the risk of severe ill­nesses. There is no doubt that per­sons whom we call neur­otic remain infant­ile in their atti­tude towards danger, and have not grown out of anti­quated con­di­tions for anxi­ety. Let us accept this as a fac­tual con­tri­bu­tion to our char­ac­ter­iz­a­tion of neur­ot­ics; why it should be so is not so easy to say.</p>
<p>I hope you have not lost the thread of our dis­course, and that you remem­ber that we are dis­cuss­ing the rela­tions between anxi­ety and repres­sion. We have dis­covered two new facts in doing so: first, that anxi­ety causes repres­sion, and not the other way round as we used to think, and secondly, that fright­en­ing <em>instinctual</em> situ­ations can in the last resort be traced back to <em>external</em> situ­ations of danger. Our next ques­tion will be: How can we pic­ture the pro­cess of repres­sion car­ried out under the influ­ence of anxi­ety? I think this is what hap­pens: the ego becomes aware that the sat­is­fac­tion of some nas­cent instinctual demand would evoke one among the well-remembered danger-situ­ations. This instinctual cathexis must, there­fore, some­how or other be sup­pressed, removed, made power­less. We know that the ego suc­ceeds in this task if it is strong, and if it has assim­il­ated the impulse in ques­tion into its organ­isa­tion. In the case of repres­sion, how­ever, the impulse is still a part of the id, and the ego feels weak. In such a con­tin­gency, the ego calls to its aid a tech­nique, which is, at bottom, identical with that of normal think­ing. Think­ing is an exper­i­mental deal­ing with small quant­it­ies of energy, just as a gen­eral moves mini­ature fig­ures about over a map before set­ting his troops in motion. In this way, the ego anti­cip­ates the sat­is­fac­tion of the ques­tion­able impulse, and enables it to repro­duce the pain­ful feel­ings which are attached to the begin­ning of the dreaded danger-situ­ation. Thereupon the auto­matic mech­an­ism of the pleas­ure-pain prin­ciple is brought into play and car­ries through the repres­sion of the dan­ger­ous impulse.</p>
<p>‘Stop!’ you will exclaim, ‘we cannot go so far as that with you.’ You are right; I shall have to add some­thing to what I have said, to make it seem accept­able to you. First of all, I must admit that I have tried to trans­late into the lan­guage of our normal thought a pro­cess which is in fact cer­tainly neither con­scious nor pre­conscious, and which takes place between charges of energy at some deep level of the mind that it is hard to pic­ture. But that is not a very ser­i­ous objec­tion; it could not be done in any other way. It is more import­ant that we should clearly dis­tin­guish between what goes on in the ego and what goes on in the id during the pro­cess of repres­sion. We have just explained what the ego does. It makes use of an exper­i­mental cathexis, and by means of a danger-signal sets in motion the auto­matic pleas­ure-pain mech­an­ism. Sev­eral reac­tions then become pos­sible, or a com­bin­a­tion of them, in vari­ous pro­por­tions. Either the anxi­ety attack devel­ops com­pletely and the ego with­draws entirely from the objec­tion­able excit­a­tion; or, in place of the exper­i­mental cathexis, the ego meets the excit­a­tion with an anti-cathexis (counter-charge) which then com­bines with the energy of the repressed impulse to form a symp­tom, or is taken up into the ego as a reac­tion-form­a­tion, as an intens­i­fic­a­tion of cer­tain dis­pos­i­tions, as a per­man­ent alter­a­tion of the ego. The more the devel­op­ment of anxi­ety can be restric­ted to a mere signal, the more the ego can make use of defens­ive acts, which amount to a mental bind­ing of the repressed, and the more the pro­cess approx­im­ates to the stand­ard of a normal modi­fic­a­tion of the impulse, without of course ever reach­ing it. Here I shall digress for a moment or so. You will, no doubt, yourselves have assumed that the thing which is so hard to define but which we call ‘char­ac­ter’ must be thought of as belong­ing entirely to the province of the ego. We have already learnt some­thing of what it is that cre­ates this thing called char­ac­ter. The incor­por­a­tion of the early par­ental func­tion in the shape of the super-ego is no doubt the most import­ant and decis­ive ele­ment; next come iden­ti­fic­a­tions with the par­ents of a later date and with other per­sons in author­ity, and the same iden­ti­fic­a­tions as pre­cip­it­ates of aban­doned object-rela­tions. We can now add to this list, as con­tri­bu­tions to char­ac­ter-form­a­tion which are never absent, the reac­tion-form­a­tions, which the ego acquires, first in making its repres­sions, and later in a more normal way, in repu­di­at­ing undesir­able impulses.</p>
<p>Now let us go back to a con­sid­er­a­tion of the id. It is not so easy to dis­cover what it is that hap­pens during the pro­cess of repres­sion to the impulses that are being opposed. The main ques­tion to which we want to know the answer is: What hap­pens to the energy, to the libid­inal charge of the impulse, and how is it used? You will remem­ber that my earlier hypo­thesis was that it was pre­cisely this energy that was turned into anxi­ety. We can, how­ever, no longer ven­ture to say that; we must con­tent ourselves with a more modest answer. Its fate is prob­ably not always the same. Prob­ably there is a close cor­res­pond­ence between what hap­pens in the ego and what hap­pens in the id with respect to the repressed impulse, and it should be pos­sible to learn some­thing of its nature. For, since we have adop­ted the view that the pleas­ure-pain prin­ciple is brought into action in response to the danger-signal, and plays a part in repres­sion, we are obliged to modify our anti­cip­a­tions. This prin­ciple has unres­tric­ted sway over the pro­cesses in the id. We can credit it too with the power of bring­ing about very pro­found changes in the impulse in ques­tion. We are there­fore pre­pared to believe that the effects of repres­sion will be very varied, and some­times more and some­times less extens­ive. In many cases the repressed impulse may retain its libid­inal cathexis, and con­tinue to exist unaltered in the id, although under the per­petual pres­sure of the ego. In other instances it seems to undergo com­plete destruc­tion, in which case its libido is finally diver­ted into other chan­nels. I have sug­ges­ted that this is what hap­pens where the Oed­ipus com­plex is dealt with nor­mally. In this desir­able state of affairs, the Oed­ipus com­plex would thus not merely be repressed, but would be actu­ally des­troyed in the id. Clin­ical exper­i­ence has fur­ther taught us that in a great many cases, instead of the usual result of repres­sion, a degrad­a­tion of the libido takes place, a regres­sion of the libid­inal organ­isa­tion to an earlier stage of devel­op­ment. That can nat­ur­ally only happen in the id, and when it does happen, it must be under the influ­ence of the same con­flict that was intro­duced by the danger-signal. The most remark­able example of this is to be found in the obses­sional neur­osis, where regres­sion of libido and repres­sion go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—I am afraid that this account will seem to you very dif­fi­cult to follow, and you will guess that it is by no means a com­plete one. I am sorry to have caused you annoy­ance. My only aim, how­ever, must be to give you some impres­sion of the nature of our find­ings, and of the dif­fi­culties we have to face in deal­ing with them. The deeper we probe in our study of mental pro­cesses, the more we become aware of the rich­ness and com­plex­ity of their con­tent. Many simple for­mu­las which seemed to us at first to meet the case, turned out later to be inad­equate. We are incess­antly alter­ing and improv­ing them. In my lec­ture on the theory of dreams, I led you into a field of know­ledge in which hardly a single new dis­cov­ery has been made in the last fif­teen years; here, where we are deal­ing with anxi­ety, everything is in a state of flux and change. These new find­ings have not yet been thor­oughly worked over, and per­haps for that very reason their expos­i­tion is dif­fi­cult. How­ever, you must have patience; we shall soon be able to leave the prob­lem of anxi­ety, though that does not mean that it will have been solved to our sat­is­fac­tion. I hope, how­ever, that we have advanced a step fur­ther. And incid­ent­ally we have acquired much fresh know­ledge. Thus we are now able, through the study of anxi­ety, to add a fresh trait to our char­ac­ter­isa­tion of the ego. We have said that the ego is weak in rela­tion to the id, that it is its faith­ful ser­vant, and that it tries to carry out its orders and fulfil its require­ments. We have no inten­tion of with­draw­ing this asser­tion. But on the other hand the ego is the better organ­ised part of the id, ori­ent­ated as it is towards real­ity. We must not exag­ger­ate too much the sep­ar­a­tion between the two, and we must not be sur­prised if the ego, too, on its side exerts an influ­ence on the pro­cesses in the id. I think the ego exerts an influ­ence of this kind when it sets the all-power­ful pleas­ure-pain prin­ciple in motion by means of the danger-signal. It is true that imme­di­ately after­wards it dis­plays its weak­ness again, for by the act of repres­sion it renounces a por­tion of its organ­isa­tion, and is obliged to allow the repressed impulse to remain per­man­ently with­drawn from its influ­ence.</p>
<p>And now just one more point in regard to the prob­lem of anxi­ety. Neur­otic anxi­ety has, under our hands, turned into object­ive anxi­ety, into anxi­ety felt towards cer­tain external danger-situ­ations. But we cannot leave it at that; we must take a step fur­ther, though in a sense it will be a step back­wards. What is it that is actu­ally dan­ger­ous and actu­ally feared in such a danger-situ­ation? It is clearly not the object­ive injury, which need have abso­lutely no import­ance psy­cho­lo­gic­ally, but it is some­thing which is set up in the mind by it. Birth, for example, our pro­to­type for the state of anxi­ety, can hardly in itself be regarded as an injury, although it may involve a risk of injury. The fun­da­mental thing about birth, as about every danger-situ­ation, is that it evokes in mental exper­i­ence a con­di­tion of tense excit­a­tion, which is felt as pain, and which cannot be mastered by dis­charge. Let us call such a situ­ation, in which the efforts of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple come to noth­ing, a ‘trau­matic’ factor; in that way, by fol­low­ing the series, neur­otic anxi­ety—object­ive anxi­ety—danger-situ­ation, we can arrive at a simple for­mula: what is feared, the object of the anxi­ety, is always the emer­gence of a trau­matic factor, which cannot be dealt with in accord­ance with the norms of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple. We can imme­di­ately see that the oper­a­tion of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple does not guar­an­tee us against object­ive injury, but only against a par­tic­u­lar injury to our mental eco­nomy. From the pleas­ure-prin­ciple to the instinct of self-pre­ser­va­tion is a long way; and the two tend­en­cies are far from coin­cid­ing from the first. We can observe some­thing else, how­ever, and per­haps this is the solu­tion for which we were look­ing. I have in mind the fact that all along we are deal­ing with ques­tions of rel­at­ive quant­it­ies. It is only the mag­nitude of the excit­a­tion which turns an impres­sion into a trau­matic factor, which para­lyses the oper­a­tion of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple and gives sig­ni­fic­ance to the danger-situ­ation. And if this is really the case, if these prob­lems admit of such a simple solu­tion, why should it not be pos­sible that trau­matic factors of this kind should occur in the mental life without rela­tion to the sup­posed danger-situ­ations, trau­matic factors in regard to which anxi­ety is not aroused as a signal, but mani­fests itself afresh and for new reas­ons? Clin­ical exper­i­ence def­in­itely tells us that this actu­ally occurs. Only the later repres­sions dis­play the mech­an­ism which we have described, in which anxi­ety is called forth as a signal of an earlier danger-situ­ation; the earli­est and most fun­da­mental repres­sions arise dir­ectly from trau­matic factors, where the ego comes into con­tact with an excess­ive libid­inal demand; these trau­matic factors create their own anxi­ety anew, though in accord­ance with the pat­tern of the birth-situ­ation. The same may be true of the devel­op­ment of anxi­ety in anxi­ety-neur­oses, caused by somatic injury of the sexual func­tion. We shall no longer main­tain that it is the libido itself that is turned into anxi­ety in such cases. But I can see no objec­tion to pos­tu­lat­ing two­fold origin of anxi­ety, first as the direct effect of a trau­matic factor, and secondly, as a signal that a trau­matic factor of this kind threatens to recur.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—I am sure you are delighted with the pro­spect of hear­ing no more about anxi­ety. But your delight will be short-lived, for what is to follow is no better. I pro­pose to take you straight on to the sub­ject of the theory of the libido or of the instincts for there too many new devel­op­ments have occurred. I cannot say that we have made any very great pro­gress or that any trouble you may take in learn­ing about it will be amply rewar­ded. No; it is a field in which we are strug­gling hard to get some sort of ori­ent­a­tion and under­stand­ing; you will only be wit­nesses of the efforts we are making. Here too I shall have to repeat much that I put before you in my earlier lec­tures.</p>
<p>The theory of the instincts is, as it were, our myth­o­logy. The instincts are myth­ical beings, superb in their indef­in­ite­ness. In our work we cannot for a moment over­look them, and yet we are never cer­tain that we are seeing them clearly. You know how pop­u­lar thought deals with the instincts. It pos­tu­lates as many dif­fer­ent instincts as may be needed, an instinct of assert­ive­ness, instincts of imit­a­tion and play, a social instinct and a great many more besides. It takes them up, as it were, lets each do its par­tic­u­lar work, and then drops them again. We have always sus­pec­ted that behind this mul­ti­tude of small occa­sional instincts there lies some­thing much more ser­i­ous and power­ful, which must be approached with cir­cum­spec­tion. Our first step was tent­at­ive enough. We felt we should prob­ably not go far wrong if we star­ted by dis­tin­guish­ing two main instincts, or spe­cies or groups of instincts, cor­res­pond­ing to our two great needs—hunger and love. How­ever jeal­ously we may in other con­nec­tions have defen­ded the inde­pend­ence of psy­cho­logy from all other sci­ences, nev­er­the­less we are here over­shad­owed by the immut­able bio­lo­gical fact that the living indi­vidual serves two pur­poses, self-pre­ser­va­tion and the pre­ser­va­tion of the spe­cies, which seem to be inde­pend­ent of each other, which we have not been able to trace back to a common source, and whose interests often con­flict in animal life. Here we are really dis­cuss­ing bio­lo­gical psy­cho­logy, we are study­ing the psy­cho­lo­gical con­com­it­ants of bio­lo­gical pro­cesses. In accord­ance with this view, we intro­duced the ‘ego-instincts’ and the ‘sexual instincts’ into psycho-ana­lysis. Under the former head­ing we placed everything that had to do with the pre­ser­va­tion, main­ten­ance and advance­ment of the indi­vidual. To the latter we ascribed the rich con­tent implied in infant­ile and per­verse sexual life. Our invest­ig­a­tion of the neur­oses led us to regard the ego as the restrict­ing and repress­ing force and the sexual impulses as the restric­ted and repressed ones, with the result that we thought we had firmly grasped not only the dif­fer­ence between the two groups of instincts, but the con­flict between them. At first the objects of our stud­ies con­sisted only of the sexual impulses, whose energy we called the ‘libido.’ From the study of them we tried to make out what an instinct was and what attrib­utes it pos­sessed. At this point we reach the theory of the libido.</p>
<p>An instinct dif­fers from a stim­u­lus in that it arises from sources of stim­u­la­tion within the body, oper­ates as a con­stant force, and is such that the sub­ject cannot escape from it by flight as he can from an external stim­u­lus. An instinct may be described as having a source, an object and an aim. The source is a state of excit­a­tion within the body, and its aim is to remove that excit­a­tion; in the course of its path from its source to the attain­ment of its aim the instinct becomes oper­at­ive men­tally. We pic­ture it as a cer­tain sum of energy for­cing its way in a cer­tain dir­ec­tion. We speak of active and pass­ive instincts, but we ought rather to speak of active and pass­ive instinctual aims; for an expendit­ure of activ­ity is required even in order to attain a pass­ive aim. The aim can be attained in the sub­ject’s own body, but as a rule an external object is intro­duced, in which the instinct attains its external aim; its internal aim is always a somatic modi­fic­a­tion which is exper­i­enced as sat­is­fac­tion. Whether the rela­tion to a somatic source gives the instinct any spe­cific char­ac­ters, and if so which, is not at all clear. The evid­ence of ana­lytic exper­i­ence proves con­clus­ively that instinctual impulses from one source can join on to instinctual impulses from another and share their fur­ther vicis­situdes, and that in gen­eral the sat­is­fac­tion of one instinct can be sub­sti­tuted for the sat­is­fac­tion of another. It must be freely admit­ted, how­ever, that we are not very clear about the explan­a­tion of this. The rela­tions of an instinct to its aim and to its object are also sus­cept­ible to alter­a­tions; both can be exchanged for others, but the rela­tion to the object is the more easily loosened of the two. There is a par­tic­u­lar kind of modi­fic­a­tion of aim and change of object, with regard to which our social values come into the pic­ture; to this we give the name of ‘<em>sub­lim­a­tion</em>’. We have also grounds for the dif­fer­en­ti­ation of what we call ‘<em>aim-inhib­ited</em>’ instincts; these pro­ceed from famil­iar sources and have unam­bigu­ous aims, but come to a stop on their way to sat­is­fac­tion, with the result that a per­man­ent object-cathexis and an endur­ing driv­ing force come into being. Of such a kind, for instance, is the feel­ing of affec­tion, whose source undoubtedly lies in sexual needs but invari­ably renounces their grat­i­fic­a­tion. We are, as you see, still in ignor­ance about many of the char­ac­ter­ist­ics of the instincts and their his­tory. We ought here to men­tion another dis­tinc­tion between the sexual instincts and the instincts of self-pre­ser­va­tion which would be of the utmost the­or­et­ical import­ance, if it applied to the whole group. The sexual instincts are remark­able for their plas­ti­city, for the facil­ity with which they can change their aims, for their inter­change­ab­il­ity—for the ease with which they can sub­sti­tute one form of grat­i­fic­a­tion for another, and for the way in which they can be held in sus­pense, as has been so well illus­trated by the aim-inhib­ited instincts. It would be con­veni­ent if we could assert that these char­ac­ter­ist­ics do not apply to the instincts of self-pre­ser­va­tion, and that the latter are inflex­ible, do not allow of delay, are far more imper­at­ive and respond quite dif­fer­ently to repres­sion and anxi­ety. On reflex­ion, how­ever, we see that this pecu­li­ar­ity does not apply to all the ego-instincts but only to those of hunger and thirst, and is clearly due to the spe­cial nature of their instinctual sources. A great deal of our per­plex­ity also arises from the fact that we have not devoted any atten­tion to the alter­a­tions which the instinctual impulses ori­gin­ally belong­ing to the id undergo under the influ­ence of the organ­ised ego.</p>
<p>We find ourselves on firmer ground when we turn to the ques­tion of how the instinctual life serves the sexual func­tion. Here we have obtained decis­ive inform­a­tion; but you are already famil­iar with it. We do not, that is to say, believe that there is a single sexual instinct, which is from the first the vehicle of the impulse towards the aim of the sexual func­tion, that is, the union of the two sex cells. On the con­trary, we see a large number of com­pon­ent instincts, arising from vari­ous regions of the body, which strive for sat­is­fac­tion more or less inde­pend­ently of one another, and find this sat­is­fac­tion in some­thing that may be called ‘<em>organ-pleas­ure</em>’. The gen­it­als are the latest of these <em>erot­o­genic zones</em>; and their organ-pleas­ure must cer­tainly be called ‘sexual.’ Not all of these pleas­ure-seek­ing impulses are incor­por­ated in the final organ­isa­tion of the sexual func­tion. Many of them are put aside as use­less, by means of repres­sion or in some other way; some of them are deflec­ted from their aims in the remark­able manner which we have already men­tioned and used for the strength­en­ing of other impulses; while others per­sist, but play minor parts, and serve the pur­pose of bring­ing about pre­lim­in­ary actions and of arous­ing fore-pleas­ure. You have heard that in this long-drawn-out course of devel­op­ment sev­eral phases of pro­vi­sional organ­isa­tion are to be recog­nised, and that aber­ra­tions and mal-devel­op­ments of the sexual func­tion are to be explained by ref­er­ence to its his­tory. The first of these <em>pre­gen­ital</em> phases is called the <em>oral</em> phase, because, in accord­ance with the fact that the infant is nour­ished through the mouth, the erot­o­genic zone of the mouth dom­in­ates what we may call the sexual activ­ity of this period of life. At a second stage the <em>sad­istic</em> and <em>anal</em> impulses come to the fore, obvi­ously in con­nec­tion with the cut­ting of the teeth, the strength­en­ing of the mus­cu­lature, and the con­trol of the sphinc­ters. We have learnt a great many inter­est­ing details about this remark­able stage of devel­op­ment in par­tic­u­lar. Third comes the <em>phal­lic</em> phase, in which for both sexes the penis (and what cor­res­ponds to it in the girl) achieves an import­ance which can no longer be over­looked. We have reserved the name of <em>gen­ital</em> phase for the final sexual organ­isa­tion, estab­lished after puberty, in which the female gen­it­als receive for the first time the recog­ni­tion which the male gen­it­als have long since obtained.</p>
<p>So far all this has been mere recapit­u­la­tion. And you must not sup­pose that the things which I have omit­ted to men­tion this time no longer hold true. This recapit­u­la­tion was neces­sary so that we could have a start­ing-point for our account of the fur­ther advance in our know­ledge. We can flat­ter ourselves that we have obtained a great deal of new inform­a­tion pre­cisely about this matter of the early organ­isa­tions of the libido and that we have a better under­stand­ing of what we already knew—in proof of which I will give you a few instances. In 1924 Abra­ham showed that we can dif­fer­en­ti­ate two stages in the sad­istic-anal phase. In the former of these the destruct­ive tend­en­cies to anni­hil­ate and to get rid of things have the upper hand, while in the latter those tend­en­cies pre­dom­in­ate which are friendly to the object, and seek to pos­sess things and hold them fast. In the middle of this phase, then, there appears for the first time a con­sid­er­a­tion for the object, which is a fore­run­ner of a later rela­tion of love towards the object. We are equally jus­ti­fied in assum­ing a sim­ilar sub­di­vi­sion in the first or oral phase. In the earlier stage of it we only have oral incor­por­a­tion, and there is no ambi­val­ence in the rela­tion to the object, <em>i.e.</em> the mother’s breast. The second stage, which is dis­tin­guished by the onset of biting activ­it­ies, may be called the ‘<em>oral-sad­istic</em>’ stage. It is here that we get the first mani­fest­a­tions of ambi­val­ence, which become so much more obvi­ous in the next, or sad­istic-anal phase. The value of these new dif­fer­en­ti­ations becomes espe­cially clear when we want to dis­cover the pre­dis­pos­i­tional points of the libid­inal devel­op­ment in the case of cer­tain neur­oses—such as obses­sional neur­osis and mel­an­cho­lia. I need only recall to you here what we have learnt on the sub­ject of fix­a­tion of libido, pre­dis­pos­i­tion and regres­sion.</p>
<p>Our atti­tude to the phases of libid­inal organ­isa­tion has in gen­eral altered some­what. We used formerly to emphas­ise the way in which one phase gives place to the next; nowadays, we direct our atten­tion more to the facts which indic­ate how much of each earlier phase per­sists side by side with, and behind, later organ­isa­tions, and obtains per­man­ent rep­res­ent­a­tion in the eco­nomy of the libido and in the char­ac­ter of the indi­vidual. Even more import­ant are those invest­ig­a­tions which have shown us how fre­quently under patho­lo­gical con­di­tions regres­sion to earlier phases takes place, and that cer­tain regres­sions are char­ac­ter­istic of cer­tain forms of ill­ness. I cannot, how­ever, go into that ques­tion here; it is a matter for a spe­cial­ised treat­ise on the psy­cho­logy of the neur­oses.</p>
<p>We have been able to study the trans­form­a­tion of instincts and sim­ilar pro­cesses, espe­cially with ref­er­ence to anal-erot­ism, in which the impulses have their source in the erot­o­genic anal zone, and we are sur­prised to find the mul­ti­pli­city of the chan­nels along which these instinctual impulses can be dir­ec­ted. It is per­haps not easy to free one­self from the con­temp­tu­ous atti­tude which we have come to adopt towards this par­tic­u­lar zone during the course of our devel­op­ment. It is as well, there­fore, to bear in mind Abra­ham’s reminder that embry­olo­gic­ally the anus cor­res­ponds to the prim­it­ive mouth, which has moved down to the end of the bowel. It appears, then, that when, in the course of devel­op­ment, the indi­vidual comes to feel dis­fa­vour for his own faeces or excre­ment, his instinctual interest arising from anal sources passes over to objects which can be given away as gifts. And rightly so, for faeces were the first gift that the infant could make, and he parted with them out of love for the person who looked after him. Sub­sequently the old interest in faeces turns into an appre­ci­ation of gold and money, and also makes a con­tri­bu­tion to the affect­ive cathexis attach­ing to the ideas of child and penis. It is the view of all chil­dren, who, as we know, cling to the cloaca-theory for a long time, that babies are born out of the bowel, like a piece of faeces; defaec­a­tion is the pro­to­type of the act of birth. But the penis, too, has its fore­run­ner in the column of faeces, which fills the mucous mem­brane tube of the bowel and stim­u­lates it. When the child has unwill­ingly imbibed the know­ledge that there are human beings who do not pos­sess a penis, that organ seems to him some­thing which can be detached from the body, and an unmis­tak­able ana­logy is drawn between it and the excre­ment which was the first piece of bodily sub­stance that had to be given up. A large quant­ity of anal-erot­ism is thus trans­ferred to the cathexis of the penis. But the interest in that part of the body has, besides an anal-erotic basis, a per­haps even more power­ful root in oral erot­ism; for in accord­ance with the situ­ation of suck­ing, the penis derives a great deal from the nipple of the mother’s breast.</p>
<p>It is impossible to have any under­stand­ing of people’s phant­as­ies, or of asso­ci­ations which occur under the influ­ence of the uncon­scious, or of the lan­guage of symp­toms, if one does not know about these deep-lying con­nec­tions. On this level, faeces-money-gift-child-penis are taken as having the same mean­ing, and can be rep­res­en­ted by the same sym­bols. You must not forget that I can only give you very incom­plete inform­a­tion on the sub­ject. I will, how­ever, add in passing that the late awaken­ing interest in the vagina is mainly of anal-erotic deriv­a­tion. This is not to be wondered at, since the vagina is, in the admir­able phrase of Lou Andreas-Salomé, ‘hired out’ from the rectum; and in the lives of homo­sexu­als, who have not got beyond a cer­tain stage in their sexual devel­op­ment, the vagina is once more rep­res­en­ted by the anus. In dreams we often meet with a place which was formerly a single room, but is now divided into two by a par­ti­tion wall, or vice versa. This always refers to the rela­tion of the vagina to the rectum. We can also follow very clearly the way in which in a girl, the entirely unfem­in­ine desire for the pos­ses­sion of a penis nor­mally turns into the desire for a child, and then for a man as the bearer of the penis and the giver of the child, so that in this case too we can see how an ele­ment of what was ori­gin­ally an anal-erotic interest is taken up into the later gen­ital organ­isa­tion.</p>
<p>In the course of these stud­ies of the pre­gen­ital phases of the libido, we have gleaned some new pieces of inform­a­tion about the form­a­tion of char­ac­ter. We have been made aware of a triad of char­ac­ter­ist­ics which are almost always to be found together: order­li­ness, parsi­mo­ni­ous­ness and obstin­acy, and we have con­cluded from the ana­lysis of per­sons pos­sess­ing them that these char­ac­ter­ist­ics pro­ceed from the dis­sip­a­tion of their anal-erot­ism and its employ­ment in other ways. Where this remark­able com­bin­a­tion is to be found, there­fore, we speak of an ‘<em>anal char­ac­ter</em>,’ and in a sense con­trast it with unmod­i­fied anal-erot­ism. A sim­ilar and per­haps even firmer con­nec­tion is to be found between ambi­tion and urethral erot­ism. We have found a remark­able ref­er­ence to this cor­rel­a­tion in the legend that Alex­an­der the Great was born on the same night that a cer­tain Her­o­stratus, from a crav­ing for notori­ety, set fire to the famous temple of Artemis at Eph­esus. It seems that the ancients were well aware of the con­nec­tion involved. You already know how close a con­nec­tion there is between urin­a­tion and fire and the put­ting out of fire. Nat­ur­ally we expect to find that other traits of char­ac­ter will also turn out to be derived from pre­gen­ital libid­inal form­a­tions, either as pre­cip­it­ates or as reac­tion-form­a­tions; but we cannot as yet demon­strate this.</p>
<p>It is now time for me to turn back to an earlier stage of our prob­lem, and again take up the ques­tion of instinctual life in its most gen­eral aspect. The con­trast between ego-instincts and sexual instincts lay to begin with at the bottom of our theory of the libido. When, later on, we began to study the ego in greater detail, and came to under­stand the idea of nar­ciss­ism, this dis­tinc­tion itself lost its valid­ity. In cer­tain rare cases one observes that the ego takes itself as object, and behaves as if it were in love with itself. For this reason we have bor­rowed the name of ‘<em>nar­ciss­ism</em>’ from the Greek legend. But that is only an extreme exag­ger­a­tion of the normal course of events. We must under­stand that the ego is always the main reser­voir of libido, from which libid­inal cathexes of objects pro­ceed, and into which they return again, while the greater part of this libido remains per­petu­ally in the ego. There is there­fore a con­stant trans­form­a­tion of ego-libido into object-libido, and of object-libido into ego-libido. But if this is so the two cannot differ from each other in their nature, and there is no point in dis­tin­guish­ing the energy of the one from that of the other; one can either drop the term ‘libido’ alto­gether, or use it as mean­ing the same as psychic energy in gen­eral.</p>
<p>We did not keep to this point of view for long. The idea of con­trast­ing forces within the instinctual life was soon given another and more pre­cise mean­ing. I shall not go through the pro­cesses by which I arrived at this new point of view; it, too, rests essen­tially on bio­lo­gical con­sid­er­a­tions; I will put it before you as a fin­ished art­icle. We sup­pose that there are two fun­da­ment­ally dif­fer­ent kinds of instincts, the sexual instincts in the widest sense of the word (Eros, if you prefer that name) and the aggress­ive instincts, whose aim is destruc­tion. When it is put like that, you will hardly think of it as any­thing new; it looks as though it were a the­or­et­ical glor­i­fic­a­tion of the com­mon­place oppos­i­tion between love and hate, which may per­haps coin­cide with the polar­ity of attrac­tion and repul­sion which phys­ics pos­tu­lates for the inor­ganic world. But it is remark­able that this hypo­thesis was nev­er­the­less felt by many to be an innov­a­tion, and indeed a most undesir­able one which ought to be got rid of as soon as pos­sible. I think a strong emo­tional factor was respons­ible for this rejec­tion. Why have we ourselves taken so long to bring ourselves to recog­nise the exist­ence of an aggress­ive instinct? Why was there so much hes­it­a­tion in using for our theory facts which lay ready to hand and were famil­iar to every one? One would prob­ably meet with but little oppos­i­tion if one were to ascribe to anim­als an instinct with such an aim as this. But to intro­duce it into the human con­sti­tu­tion seems impi­ous; it con­tra­dicts too many reli­gious pre­ju­dices and social con­ven­tions. No, man must be by nature good, or at least good-natured. If he occa­sion­ally shows him­self to be brutal, viol­ent and cruel, these are only passing dis­turb­ances of his emo­tional life, mostly pro­voked, and per­haps only the con­sequence of the ill-adap­ted social system which he has so far made for him­self.</p>
<p>Unfor­tu­nately the testi­mony of his­tory and our own exper­i­ence do not bear this out, but rather con­firm the judg­ment that the belief in the ‘good­ness’ of man’s nature is one of those unfor­tu­nate illu­sions from which man­kind expects some kind of beau­ti­fy­ing or ameli­or­a­tion of their lot, but which in real­ity bring only dis­aster. We need not pro­ceed with this polemic; for it is not on account of the teach­ing of his­tory and of our own exper­i­ence of life that we main­tain the hypo­thesis of a spe­cial instinct of aggres­sion and destruct­ive­ness in man, but on account of gen­eral con­sid­er­a­tions, to which we were led in trying to estim­ate the import­ance of the phe­nom­ena of <em>sadism</em> and <em>mas­ochism</em>. You know that we use the word ‘sadism’ when sexual sat­is­fac­tion depends upon the sexual object suf­fer­ing pain, ill-treat­ment and humi­li­ation, and the word ‘mas­ochism,’ when the sub­ject him­self has to suffer such treat­ment. You know, too, that there is a cer­tain admix­ture of these two tend­en­cies in normal sexual rela­tions, and that we call them ‘per­ver­sions’ when they thrust the other sexual aims into the back­ground, and sub­sti­tute their own aims for them. It can hardly have escaped you that sadism has a close con­nec­tion with mas­culin­ity, and mas­ochism with fem­in­in­ity, as if there were some secret rela­tion­ship between them. I must tell you at once that we have made no fur­ther pro­gress along this path. Both of them, sadism and mas­ochism, are very hard to account for by the theory of the libido, and espe­cially mas­ochism; and it is only right and proper that the stone which was an obstacle to the one theory should become the corner­stone of the other.</p>
<p>For we believe that in sadism and mas­ochism we have two admir­able examples of the fusion of the two kinds of instincts, Eros and aggress­ive­ness, and we now put for­ward the hypo­thesis that this rela­tion­ship is typ­ical and that all the instinctual impulses that we can study are made up of such fusions or alloys of the two kinds of instincts. Nat­ur­ally they are to be found mixed in the greatest vari­ety of pro­por­tions. To this mix­ture the erotic instincts will con­trib­ute the whole mul­ti­pli­city of their sexual aims, while the others will admit only of mit­ig­a­tion and gradu­ation of their uni­form tend­ency. This hypo­thesis opens up a line of invest­ig­a­tion which may some day be of great import­ance for the under­stand­ing of patho­lo­gical pro­cesses. For fusions may be undone, and such defu­sions of instincts may be expec­ted to bring about the most ser­i­ous con­sequences to adequate func­tion­ing. But this point of view is still too new; no one has so far attemp­ted to make prac­tical use of it.</p>
<p>Let us return to the spe­cific prob­lem which is presen­ted by mas­ochism. If we put its erotic com­pon­ents on one side for a moment, it proves the exist­ence of a tend­ency which has self-destruc­tion as its aim. We have already stated that the ego (or rather, as we should here say, the id, the whole per­son­al­ity) ori­gin­ally includes all the instinctual impulses; if this applies equally to the destruct­ive instinct, it will follow that mas­ochism is older than sadism; and that sadism is the destruct­ive instinct dir­ec­ted out­wards, thereby acquir­ing the char­ac­ter of aggress­ive­ness. Vary­ing quant­it­ies of the ori­ginal destruct­ive instinct may still remain inside the organ­ism; it seems as though we could only per­ceive it under two con­di­tions, either when it is bound up with the erotic instincts so as to form mas­ochism, or when it is turned on to the external world (with a greater or lesser erotic addi­tion) in the shape of aggress­ive­ness. We are now led to con­sider the import­ant pos­sib­il­ity of the aggres­sion being unable to find sat­is­fac­tion in the external world, because it comes up against object­ive hindrances. It may then per­haps turn back, and increase the amount of self-destruct­ive­ness within. We shall see that this actu­ally occurs, and that it is an event of great import­ance. It would seem that aggres­sion when it is impeded entails ser­i­ous injury, and that we have to des­troy other things and other people, in order not to des­troy ourselves, in order to pro­tect ourselves from the tend­ency to self-destruc­tion. A sad dis­clos­ure, it will be agreed, for the Mor­al­ist.</p>
<p>But the Mor­al­ist will, for a long time to come, con­sole him­self with the improb­ab­il­ity of our spec­u­la­tions. It is indeed a strange instinct that is occu­pied with the destruc­tion of its own organic home! It is true that the poets speak of things of this sort; but poets are irre­spons­ible beings, they enjoy the priv­ilege of poetic licence. But, after all, such ideas are not for­eign to physiology, where we find, for instance, the mucous mem­brane of the stom­ach digest­ing itself. But it must be admit­ted that our instinct of self-destruc­tion requires more con­firm­a­tion. One cannot put for­ward a hypo­thesis that is so far-reach­ing, simply on the ground that a few poor fools have attached a curi­ous con­di­tion to their sexual sat­is­fac­tion. I think that a deeper study of the instincts will give us what we want. The instincts do not only dom­in­ate mental life, but veget­at­ive life as well, and these organic instincts dis­play a char­ac­ter­istic which merits our most ser­i­ous atten­tion. Whether it is a gen­eral char­ac­ter­istic of all instincts we shall only be able to decide later. They turn out to be dir­ec­ted towards the rein­state­ment of an earlier state of things. We may assume that as soon as a given state of things is upset there arises an instinct to recre­ate it, and phe­nom­ena appear which we may call ‘repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion.’ Embry­ology, for instance, is noth­ing but a repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion; stretch­ing far back in the animal series we find a capa­city to form afresh organs which have been lost, and the instinct of recov­ery, to which, along­side of our thera­peutic activ­it­ies, we owe our power to get well, may be the remains of this capa­city which is so won­der­fully developed in the lower anim­als. The spawn­ing migra­tions of fish and per­haps the migra­tions of birds, pos­sibly all that we describe as a mani­fest­a­tion of instinct in anim­als, takes place under the dom­in­a­tion of repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion, which expresses the <em>con­ser­vat­ive nature</em> of instincts. And in the realm of the mind, too, we shall not have far to seek for evid­ence of the pres­ence of that com­pul­sion. It has always sur­prised us that the for­got­ten and repressed exper­i­ences of early child­hood should repro­duce them­selves in dreams and reac­tions during ana­lytic treat­ment, espe­cially in the reac­tions involved in the trans­fer­ence, although their reawaken­ing runs counter to the interests of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple; and we have explained this by saying that in such cases repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion has over­come even the pleas­ure-prin­ciple. Out­side ana­lysis, too, one can observe the same thing. There are people who, all their lives, repeat, to their own det­ri­ment, the same reac­tions, without any cor­rec­tion, or who seem to be dogged by a relent­less ill-for­tune, though a closer invest­ig­a­tion shows that they are unwit­tingly bring­ing this ill-for­tune upon them­selves. Thus we explain what is called a ‘<em>dae­monic</em>’ char­ac­ter as being due to the repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion.</p>
<p>But how can this con­ser­vat­ive qual­ity of instincts help us to under­stand the self-destruct­ive tend­ency? What is the earlier state of things that such an instinct is trying to rein­state? Now the answer to this ques­tion lies near at hand, and opens up a wide vista of pos­sib­il­it­ies. If it is true that once in an incon­ceiv­ably remote past, and in an unima­gin­able way, life arose out of inan­im­ate matter, then, in accord­ance with our hypo­thesis, an instinct must at that time have come into being, whose aim it was to abol­ish life once more and to re-estab­lish the inor­ganic state of things. If in this instinct we recog­nise the impulse to self-destruc­tion of our hypo­thesis, then we can regard that impulse as the mani­fest­a­tion of a <em>death instinct</em>, which can never be absent in any vital pro­cess. And now the instincts in which we believe sep­ar­ate them­selves into two groups; the erotic instincts, which are always trying to col­lect living sub­stance together into ever larger unit­ies, and the death instincts which act against that tend­ency, and try to bring living matter back into an inor­ganic con­di­tion. The co-oper­a­tion and oppos­i­tion of these two forces pro­duce the phe­nom­ena of life to which death puts an end.</p>
<p>You will per­haps shrug your shoulders and say: That is not nat­ural sci­ence, that is the philo­sophy of Schopen­hauer. But, Ladies and Gen­tle­men, why should not a bold thinker have divined some­thing that a sober and painstak­ing invest­ig­a­tion of details sub­sequently con­firms? And after all, everything has been said already, and many people said the same thing before Schopen­hauer. And besides, what we have said is not even true Schopen­hauer. We do not assert that death is the only aim of life; we do not over­look the pres­ence of life by the side of death. We recog­nise two fun­da­mental instincts, and ascribe to each of them its own aim. How the two mingle in the vital pro­cess, how the death instinct is pressed into the ser­vice of Eros, espe­cially when it is turned out­wards in the form of aggress­ive­ness,—these are prob­lems which remain for future invest­ig­a­tion. We can go no fur­ther than the point at which this pro­spect opens up before us. The ques­tion whether all instincts without excep­tion do not pos­sess a con­ser­vat­ive char­ac­ter, whether the erotic instincts also do not seek the rein­state­ment of an earlier state of things, when they strive towards the syn­thesis of living sub­stance into larger wholes—this ques­tion, too, must be left unanswered.</p>
<p>We have wandered some­what far from our thesis, but I will tell you the start­ing-point of these reflec­tions upon the theory of the instincts. It was the same thing that led us to a revi­sion of the rela­tion between the ego and the uncon­scious: the impres­sion we received from our ana­lyt­ical work that the patient who puts up a res­ist­ance very often knows noth­ing about it. But he is uncon­scious not only of the fact of his res­ist­ance but of the motives for it. It was neces­sary for us to look for these motives or this motive, and we found it to our sur­prise in a strong need for pun­ish­ment, which we could not help asso­ci­at­ing with mas­ochistic wishes. The prac­tical value of this dis­cov­ery is no less than its the­or­et­ical import­ance, for this need for pun­ish­ment is the worst enemy of our thera­peutic efforts. It is sat­is­fied by the suf­fer­ing which is bound up with the neur­osis, and there­fore holds fast to the state of ill­ness. It seems as though this factor, the uncon­scious need for pun­ish­ment, plays a part in every neur­otic dis­ease. The truth of this view is brought home to one in the most con­vin­cing way by cases in which we see neur­otic suf­fer­ing vanish at the appear­ance of suf­fer­ing of another kind. I will give you an instance of this. I once suc­ceeded in free­ing a middle-aged spin­ster from a symp­tom-com­plex that had con­demned her to a miser­able exist­ence for about fif­teen years, and had quite pre­ven­ted her from taking any part in life. She felt that she was now restored to health, and plunged into a whirl of activ­ity in order to develop her tal­ents, which were by no means small, and derive a little appre­ci­ation, enjoy­ment and suc­cess from life before it was too late. But all her attempts ended in its being made clear to her or in her seeing for her­self, that she was too old to effect any­thing in that dir­ec­tion. Every time this happened the next step for her would have been a relapse into her ill­ness, but that she could no longer bring about; instead of it an acci­dent would always befall her, which inca­pa­cit­ated her for some time and caused her suf­fer­ing. She would fall down and sprain her foot, or injure her knee, or else hurt her hand while she was doing some­thing or other. As soon as she saw how great a part she her­self played in these appar­ently chance acci­dents, she altered her tech­nique, as one might say. Instead of acci­dents she con­trac­ted on the same occa­sions slight ill­nesses, such as catarrhs, sore throats, influ­en­zal con­di­tions, or rheum­atic swell­ings, until at last, when she made up her mind to resign her­self to inactiv­ity, the whole busi­ness came to an end.</p>
<p>As to the origin of this uncon­scious need for pun­ish­ment, there can be, I think, no doubt. It behaves like a part of the con­science, like the pro­long­a­tion of con­science into the uncon­scious; and it must have the same origin as con­science, that is to say it will cor­res­pond to a piece of aggress­ive­ness which has been intern­al­ized and taken over by the super-ego. If only the words were less incon­gru­ous, we should be jus­ti­fied, for all prac­tical pur­poses, in call­ing it ‘an uncon­scious sense of guilt.’ The­or­et­ic­ally, as a matter of fact, we are in doubt whether we ought to sup­pose that all aggress­ive­ness that has turned back from the external world is bound by the super-ego, and so used against the ego, or whether a part of it car­ries on its silent sin­is­ter activ­ity as a free destruct­ive instinct in the ego and the id. Prob­ably there is a divi­sion of this kind, but we know noth­ing fur­ther about it. When first the super-ego is set up there is no doubt that that func­tion is endowed with that part of the child’s aggress­ive­ness against its par­ents for which it can find no dis­charge out­wards on account of its love-fix­a­tion and external dif­fi­culties; and, for this reason, the sever­ity of the super-ego need not cor­res­pond to the sever­ity of its upbring­ing. It is quite likely that when on sub­sequent occa­sions aggress­ive­ness is sup­pressed, the instinct fol­lows the path which was opened to it at that decis­ive period.</p>
<p>People in whom this uncon­scious sense of guilt is dom­in­ant, dis­tin­guish them­selves under ana­lytic treat­ment by exhib­it­ing what is so unwel­come from the point of view of pro­gnosis—a neg­at­ive thera­peutic reac­tion. In the normal course of events, if one gives a patient the solu­tion of a symp­tom, at least the tem­por­ary dis­ap­pear­ance of that symp­tom should result; with these patients, on the con­trary, the effect is a moment­ary intens­i­fic­a­tion of the symp­tom and the suf­fer­ing that accom­pan­ies it. It often needs only a word of praise of their beha­viour during the cure, the utter­ance of a few words of hope as to the pro­gress of the ana­lysis, to bring about an unmis­tak­able aggrav­a­tion of their con­di­tion. A non-ana­lyst would say that they were lack­ing in the ‘will to recov­ery’; from the ana­lyt­ical point of view their beha­viour will appear as an expres­sion of an uncon­scious sense of guilt, which favours ill­ness with its attend­ant suf­fer­ings and han­di­caps. The prob­lems raised by the uncon­scious sense of guilt, its rela­tion to mor­al­ity, edu­ca­tion, crimin­al­ity and delin­quency, is at the present moment the favour­ite field of invest­ig­a­tion for psycho-ana­lysts. Here we have quite unex­pec­tedly emerged into the open from the mental under­world. I cannot take you any fur­ther, but I will detain you for a few moments before I stop with one fur­ther con­sid­er­a­tion. We have got into the habit of saying that our civil­isa­tion is built up at the cost of our sexual impulses, which are inhib­ited by soci­ety, being partly repressed but partly, on the other hand, made use of for new aims. How­ever proud we may be of our cul­tural achieve­ments, we have admit­ted that it is by no means easy to sat­isfy the require­ments of this civil­isa­tion and to feel com­fort­able in its midst, because the restric­tion of the instincts which it involves lays a heavy psy­cho­lo­gical burden on our shoulders. Now what we have recog­nised as true of the sexual instincts holds to the same extent, and per­haps to an even greater extent, for the other instincts, for those of aggres­sion. It is they above all that make com­munal exist­ence dif­fi­cult, and threaten its per­man­ence. The lim­it­a­tion of aggres­sion is the first and per­haps the hard­est sac­ri­fice which soci­ety demands from each indi­vidual. We have learnt in what an ingeni­ous way this unruly ele­ment is tamed. The set­ting up of the super-ego, which makes the dan­ger­ous aggress­ive impulses its own, is like intro­du­cing a gar­rison into a province that is on the brink of rebel­lion. But on the other hand, look­ing at it from a purely psy­cho­lo­gical point of view, one has to admit that the ego does not feel at all com­fort­able when it finds itself sac­ri­ficed in this way to the needs of soci­ety, when it has to submit itself to the destruct­ive impulses of aggres­sion, which it would have dearly liked itself to set in motion against others. It is like a car­ry­ing-over into the region of the mind of the dilemma—eat or be eaten—which dom­in­ates the organic world. For­tu­nately the instincts of aggres­sion are never alone, they are always alloyed with the erotic ones. In the cul­tural con­di­tions which man has cre­ated for him­self the erotic instincts have much to mit­ig­ate and much to avert.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—The whole time that I have been pre­par­ing the lec­tures I am giving you, I have been strug­gling with an internal dif­fi­culty. I feel, as one might say, uncer­tain of the terms of my licence. It is quite true that in the course of fif­teen years’ work, psycho-ana­lysis has altered and grown; but in spite of that, an intro­duc­tion to psycho-ana­lysis might be left unchanged and unex­pan­ded. It is always at the back of my mind that there is no <em>raison d’étre</em> for these lec­tures. For ana­lysts I say too little and noth­ing at all that is new, while to you I say too much and relate things which you are not in a pos­i­tion to under­stand and which are not for your ears. I have looked about for excuses, and have tried to jus­tify each of my lec­tures on dif­fer­ent grounds. The first, the one about the theory of dreams, was inten­ded to put you back at once into the atmo­sphere of ana­lysis, and to show you how dur­able our hypo­theses have proved them­selves to be. I was temp­ted to give the second, which traced the con­nec­tion between dreams and the so-called occult, by the oppor­tun­ity it afforded of saying some­thing about a field of research in which at the present time pre­ju­diced expect­a­tion is strug­gling against pas­sion­ate oppos­i­tion; and I allowed myself to hope that you would not refuse me your com­pany on this exped­i­tion, but would follow me with a judg­ment edu­cated to tol­er­ance by example of psycho-ana­lysis. The third lec­ture, which dealt with the ana­tomy of the per­son­al­ity, cer­tainly made the severest demands upon you, so strange was its sub­ject-matter; but it was quite impossible for me to with­hold from you this first con­tri­bu­tion to ego-psy­cho­logy, and, if we had been in pos­ses­sion of the mater­ial fif­teen years ago, I should have had to men­tion it then. Finally, the last lec­ture, which you have prob­ably fol­lowed only with the greatest dif­fi­culty, con­tained some neces­sary emend­a­tions and new attempts at the solu­tion of the most import­ant prob­lems; and my intro­duc­tion would have been pos­it­ively mis­lead­ing if I had kept silent about them. You see how it is that when one tries to excuse one­self, it comes out in the end that everything was inev­it­able, that everything was pre-ordained. I submit to fate; and I beg that you will do the same.</p>
<p>Nor should to-day’s lec­ture find a place in an intro­duc­tion; but it may serve to give you an example of the detailed work of ana­lysis, and there are two things I can add in its favour. It con­tains noth­ing but observed facts, with hardly any spec­u­lat­ive addi­tions, and it is con­cerned with a theme which claims your atten­tion almost more than any other. Through­out the ages the prob­lem of woman has puzzled people of every kind—</p>

<p>You too will have pondered over this ques­tion in so far as you are men; from the women among you that is not to be expec­ted, for you are the riddle yourselves. Male or female is the first dif­fer­en­ti­ation that you make when you meet another human being, and you are used to making that dis­tinc­tion with abso­lute cer­tainty. Ana­tom­ical sci­ence shares your cer­tainty in one point, but not much more. Male is the male sexual secre­tion, the sper­ma­to­zoon, and its car­rier; female is the egg, and the organ­ism that con­tains it. In each sex, organs have been formed which exclus­ively sub­serve the sexual func­tions; they have prob­ably been developed from the same basis into two dif­fer­ent form­a­tions. In both sexes, moreover, the other organs, the shape of the body and the tis­sues are influ­enced by sex (the so-called sec­ond­ary sexual char­ac­ters), but this influ­ence is irreg­u­lar and vary­ing in degree. And then sci­ence tells you some­thing that runs counter to your expect­a­tions, and is prob­ably cal­cu­lated to con­fuse your feel­ings. It points out to you that parts of the male sexual appar­atus are also to be found in the body of the female, although in a rudi­ment­ary con­di­tion, and <em>vice versa</em>. Sci­ence sees in this phe­nomenon an indic­a­tion of <em>bi-sexu­al­ity</em>, as though the indi­vidual were neither man nor woman, but both at the same time, only rather more the one than the other. It then expects you to make yourselves famil­iar with the idea that the pro­por­tions in which the mas­cu­line and the fem­in­ine mingle in an indi­vidual are sub­ject to quite extraordin­ary vari­ations. And even though, apart from very rare cases, only one kind of sexual product—ova or sem­inal cells—is present in any one indi­vidual, you will go wrong if you take this factor as being of decis­ive import­ance, and you must con­clude that what con­sti­tutes mas­culin­ity or fem­in­in­ity is an unknown ele­ment which it is beyond the power of ana­tomy to grasp.</p>
<p>Can psy­cho­logy do any better? We are used to con­sider mas­cu­line and fem­in­ine as mental qual­it­ies as well, and have also car­ried the notion of bi-sexu­al­ity over into mental life. We speak of a human being, whether male or female, behav­ing in a mas­cu­line or a fem­in­ine way. But you will at once observe that that is simply fol­low­ing the lead of ana­tomy and con­ven­tion. You can give the con­cepts of mas­cu­line and fem­in­ine no new con­tent. The dif­fer­ence is not a psy­cho­lo­gical one; when you say ‘mas­cu­line,’ you mean as a rule ‘active’, and when you say ‘fem­in­ine’ you mean ‘pass­ive.’ Now it is quite true that there is such a cor­rel­a­tion. The male sexual cell is active and mobile; it seeks out the female one, while the latter, the ovum, is sta­tion­ary, and waits pass­ively. This beha­viour of the ele­ment­ary organ­isms of sex is more or less a model of the beha­viour of the indi­vidu­als of each sex in sexual inter­course. The male pur­sues the female for the pur­pose of sexual union, seizes her and pushes his way into her. But with that you have, so far as psy­cho­logy goes, reduced the qual­ity of mas­culin­ity to the factor of aggress­ive­ness. You will begin to doubt whether you have hit upon any­thing fun­da­mental here, when you con­sider that in many classes of anim­als the female is the stronger and more aggress­ive party, and the male is only active in the single act of sexual inter­course. That is the case, for instance, with spiders. The func­tions of caring for the young, too, and of rear­ing them, which seems to us so essen­tially fem­in­ine, are not, among anim­als, always asso­ci­ated with the female sex. In some spe­cies of anim­als, quite high in the scale, one finds that the sexes share in the duties of look­ing after the young, or even that the male devotes him­self to it alone. Even in the sphere of human sexual life, one soon notices how unsat­is­fact­ory it is to identify mas­cu­line beha­viour with activ­ity and fem­in­ine with passiv­ity. The mother is in every sense of the word active in her rela­tions with her child; it is just as true to say that she gives suck to the child, as that she lets it suck her breasts. The fur­ther you go from the sexual field in the nar­rower sense of the word the more appar­ent it becomes that the two ideas do not coin­cide. Women can dis­play great activ­ity in a vari­ety of dir­ec­tions, while men cannot live together with their kind unless they develop a high degree of pass­ive pli­ab­il­ity. If you thereupon say that these facts pre­cisely prove that men and women are psy­cho­lo­gic­ally bi-sexual, I shall infer that you have decided to identify activ­ity with mas­culin­ity and passiv­ity with fem­in­in­ity. But I advise you not to do that. It seems to me to serve no good pur­pose and to give us no new inform­a­tion.</p>
<p>One might make an attempt to char­ac­ter­ise fem­in­in­ity psy­cho­lo­gic­ally by saying that it involves a pref­er­ence for pass­ive aims. That is nat­ur­ally not the same as passiv­ity; it may require a good deal of activ­ity to achieve a pass­ive end. It may be that the part played by women in the sexual func­tion leads them to incline towards pass­ive beha­viour and pass­ive aims, and that this inclin­a­tion extends into their ordin­ary life to a greater or less degree, accord­ing to whether the influ­ence of her sexual life as a model is lim­ited or far-reach­ing. But we must take care not to under­es­tim­ate the influ­ence of social con­ven­tions, which also force women into pass­ive situ­ations. The whole thing is still very obscure. We must not over­look one par­tic­u­larly con­stant rela­tion between fem­in­in­ity and instinctual life. The repres­sion of their aggress­ive­ness, which is imposed upon women by their con­sti­tu­tions and by soci­ety, favours the devel­op­ment of strong mas­ochistic impulses, which have the effect of bind­ing erot­ic­ally the destruct­ive tend­en­cies which have been turned inwards. Mas­ochism is then, as they say, truly fem­in­ine. But when, as so often hap­pens, you meet with mas­ochism in men, what else can you do but say that these men dis­play obvi­ous fem­in­ine traits of char­ac­ter?</p>
<p>You are now pre­pared for the con­clu­sion that psy­cho­logy cannot solve the riddle of fem­in­in­ity. The solu­tion must, I think, come from some­where else, and it cannot come until we have learnt in gen­eral how the dif­fer­en­ti­ation of living creatures into two sexes came about. We know noth­ing whatever about the matter, and yet sex-dif­fer­en­ti­ation is a most remark­able char­ac­ter­istic in organic life, and one by which it is sharply cut off from inan­im­ate nature. Mean­while we shall find plenty to occupy ourselves with in the study of those human indi­vidu­als who are char­ac­ter­ised as mani­festly or pre­pon­der­antly female by the pos­ses­sion of female gen­it­als. It is in har­mony with the nature of psycho-ana­lysis that it does not try to describe what women are—that would be a task which it could hardly per­form—but it invest­ig­ates the way in which women develop out of chil­dren with their bi-sexual dis­pos­i­tion. We have learnt a cer­tain amount about this recently, thanks to the fact that sev­eral excel­lent women ana­lysts have begun to work on the prob­lem. A spe­cial piquancy has been lent to the dis­cus­sion of this sub­ject by the ques­tion of the dif­fer­ence between the sexes; for, whenever a com­par­ison was made which seemed to be unfa­vour­able to their sex, the ladies were able to express a sus­pi­cion, that we, the men ana­lysts, had never over­come cer­tain deep-rooted pre­ju­dices against the fem­in­ine, and that con­sequently our invest­ig­a­tions suffered from bias. On the other hand, on the basis of bi-sexu­al­ity, we found it easy to avoid any impol­ite­ness. We had only to say: ‘This does not apply to you. You are an excep­tion, in this respect you are more mas­cu­line than fem­in­ine.’</p>
<p>In approach­ing the study of the sexual devel­op­ment of women we start with two pre­con­cep­tions: firstly, that, as in the case of men, the con­sti­tu­tion will not adapt itself to its func­tion without a struggle; and secondly, that the decis­ive changes will have been set in motion or com­pleted before puberty. Both of these pre­con­cep­tions turn out to be jus­ti­fied. Fur­ther, a com­par­ison with what hap­pens in the case of the boy shows us that the devel­op­ment of the little girl into a normal woman is more dif­fi­cult and more com­plic­ated; for she has two addi­tional tasks to per­form, to which there is noth­ing cor­res­pond­ing in the devel­op­ment of the man. Let us follow the par­al­lel from the very begin­ning. Cer­tainly the ori­ginal mater­ial is dif­fer­ent in the boy and the girl; it does not require psycho-ana­lysis to find that out. The dif­fer­ence in the form­a­tion of their gen­ital organs is accom­pan­ied by other bodily dif­fer­ences, which are too famil­iar for me to need to men­tion them. In their instinctual dis­pos­i­tion, as well, there are dif­fer­ences which fore­shadow the later nature of the woman. The little girl is as a rule less aggress­ive, less defi­ant, and less self-suf­fi­cient; she seems to have a greater need for affec­tion to be shown her, and there­fore to be more depend­ent and docile. The fact that she is more easily and more quickly taught to con­trol her excre­tions is very prob­ably only the result of this docil­ity; urine and stool are, as we know, the first gifts that the child can offer to those who look after it, and con­trol over them is the first con­ces­sion which can be wrung from the instinctual life of the child. One gets the impres­sion, too, that the little girl is more intel­li­gent and more lively than the boy of the same age; she is more inclined to meet the external world half way, and, at the same time, she makes stronger object-cathexes. I do not know whether the view that she gets a start in devel­op­ment has been con­firmed by more exact obser­va­tions, but in any case it is quite clear that the little girl cannot be called intel­lec­tu­ally back­ward. But these sexual dif­fer­ences are of no great import­ance; they can be out­bal­anced by indi­vidual vari­ations. For the pur­poses which we have imme­di­ately in view they may be left on one side.</p>
<p>Both sexes seem to pass through the early phases of libid­inal devel­op­ment in the same way. One might have expec­ted that already in the sad­istic-anal phase we should find that the girl showed less aggress­ive­ness; but this is not the case. Women ana­lysts have found from the ana­lysis of chil­dren’s play that the aggress­ive impulses of little girls leave noth­ing to be desired as regards copi­ous­ness and viol­ence. With the onset of the phal­lic phase the dif­fer­ence between the sexes becomes much less import­ant than their sim­il­ar­it­ies. We are now obliged to recog­nise that the little girl is a little man. As we know, in the boy this phase is char­ac­ter­ised by the fact that he has dis­covered how to obtain pleas­ur­able sen­sa­tions from his little penis, and asso­ci­ates its state of excit­a­tion with his ideas about sexual inter­course. The little girl does the same with her even smal­ler clit­oris. It seems as though with her, all her mas­turb­at­ory actions center round this penis-equi­val­ent, and that the actual female vagina is still undis­covered by both sexes. It is true that, here and there, reports have been made that tell us of early vaginal sen­sa­tions as well; but it cannot be easy to dis­crim­in­ate between these and anal sen­sa­tions or from sen­sa­tions of the vaginal ves­ti­bule; in any case they cannot play a very import­ant role. We may assume that, in the phal­lic phase of the girl, the clit­oris is the dom­in­ant erot­o­genic zone. But it is not destined to remain so; with the change to fem­in­in­ity, the clit­oris must give up to the vagina its sens­it­iv­ity, and, with it, its import­ance, either wholly or in part. This is one of the two tasks which have to be per­formed in the course of the woman’s devel­op­ment; the more for­tu­nate man has only to con­tinue at the time of his sexual matur­ity what he has already prac­tised during the period of early sexual expan­sion.</p>
<p>We shall return to the part played by the clit­oris, but shall now pass on to the second task with which the girl’s devel­op­ment is burdened. The first love-object of the boy is his mother, and she remains as such in the form­a­tion of his Oed­ipus-com­plex, and, ulti­mately, through­out his whole life. For the little girl, too, her mother must be her first object (together with fig­ures of nurses and other attend­ants that merge into hers); the first object-cathexes, indeed, follow the lines of the sat­is­fac­tion of the great and simple needs of life, and the cir­cum­stances in which the child is nursed are the same for both sexes. In the Oed­ipus situ­ation, how­ever, the father has become the little girl’s love-object, and it is from him that, in the normal course of devel­op­ment, she should find her way to her ulti­mate object-choice. The girl has, then, in the course of time to change both her erot­o­genic zone and her object, while the boy keeps both of them unchanged. The ques­tion then arises of how this comes about. In par­tic­u­lar, how does the little girl pass from an attach­ment to her mother to an attach­ment to her father? or, in other words, how does she pass from her mas­cu­line phase into the fem­in­ine phase which has been bio­lo­gic­ally marked out for her?</p>
<p>Now it would provide us with an ideally simple solu­tion of the prob­lem if we could assume that, from a cer­tain age onwards, the ele­ment­ary influ­ence of het­ero­sexual attrac­tion makes itself felt, and draws the little girl towards men, while the same prin­ciple allows the boy to keep to his mother. One could even assume fur­ther, that, in doing this, chil­dren are fol­low­ing a hint given them by the sexual pref­er­ences of their par­ents. But things are not so con­veni­ent as this. We hardly know whether we can ser­i­ously believe in the mys­ter­i­ous and unana­lys­able force, of which the poets sing so enthu­si­ast­ic­ally. Painstak­ing invest­ig­a­tions have res­ul­ted in find­ings of quite a dif­fer­ent kind, the mater­ial for which, at all events, was easily obtain­able. You must know that the number of women who until late in life remain ten­derly attached to father-objects, or indeed to their real fath­ers, is very large. We have made the most sur­pris­ing dis­cov­er­ies about these women who dis­play intense and pro­longed father-fix­a­tions. We knew, of course, that there had been an earlier stage in which they were attached to their mother; but we did not know that it was so rich in con­tent, that it per­sisted so long, and that it could leave behind it so many occa­sions for fix­a­tions and pre­dis­pos­i­tions. During this time, their father is no more than an irk­some rival. In many cases the attach­ment to the mother lasts beyond the fourth year; almost everything that we find later in the father-rela­tion was already present in that attach­ment, and has been sub­sequently trans­ferred on to the father. In short, we gain the con­vic­tion that one cannot under­stand women, unless one estim­ates this <em>pre-oed­ipal attach­ment to the mother</em> at its proper value.</p>
<p>Now we should very much like to know what the libid­inal rela­tions of the little girl to her mother are. The answer is that they are man­i­fold. Since they pass through all the three phases of infant­ile sexu­al­ity, they take on the char­ac­ter­ist­ics of each sep­ar­ate phase, and express them­selves by means of oral, sad­istic-anal, and phal­lic wishes. These wishes rep­res­ent active as well as pass­ive impulses; if one relates them to the dif­fer­en­ti­ation of the sexes which comes about later (which one should avoid doing as far as pos­sible), one can speak of them as mas­cu­line and fem­in­ine. They are, in addi­tion, com­pletely ambi­val­ent—both of a tender and of a hos­tile-aggress­ive nature. It often hap­pens that the hos­tile wishes only become appar­ent after they have been turned into anxi­ety-ideas. It is not always easy to point out the way in which these early sexual wishes are for­mu­lated. What is most clearly expressed is the desire to get the mother with child as well as the cor­res­pond­ing one, to have a child by the mother; both belong to the phal­lic phase, and seem suf­fi­ciently strange, though their exist­ence is estab­lished beyond all doubt by ana­lytic obser­va­tion. The attrac­tion of these invest­ig­a­tions lies in the extraordin­ary facts which they bring to light. Thus, for instance, one dis­cov­ers the fear of being murdered or poisoned, which may later on form the nuc­leus of a para­noic dis­order, already present in this pre-oed­ipal stage and dir­ec­ted against the mother. Or, to take another case. You will remem­ber that inter­est­ing epis­ode in the his­tory of ana­lyt­ical research which caused me so many pain­ful hours? At the time when my main interest was dir­ec­ted on to the dis­cov­ery of infant­ile sexual trau­mas, almost all my female patients told me that they had been seduced by their fath­ers. Even­tu­ally I was forced to the con­clu­sion that these stor­ies were false, and thus I came to under­stand that hys­ter­ical symp­toms spring from phant­as­ies and not from real events. Only later was I able to recog­nise in this phant­asy of seduc­tion by the father the expres­sion of the typ­ical Oed­ipus-com­plex in woman. And now we find, in the early pre-oed­ipal his­tory of girls, the seduc­tion-phant­asy again; but the sedu­cer is invari­ably the mother. Here, how­ever, the phant­asy has a foot­ing in real­ity; for it must in fact have been the mother who aroused (per­haps for the first time) pleas­ur­able sen­sa­tions in the child’s gen­it­als in the ordin­ary course of attend­ing to its bodily needs.</p>
<p>I dare say that you are pre­pared to sus­pect that this descrip­tion of the rich­ness and strength of the sexual rela­tions of the little girl to her mother is very much exag­ger­ated. One has, after all, plenty of oppor­tun­ity of watch­ing little girls, and one notices noth­ing of the sort. But the objec­tion cannot be sus­tained. One can see enough of such things in chil­dren, if one under­stands how to observe them, and, besides this, you must con­sider how little the child is able to give pre­conscious expres­sion to its sexual wishes, and how little it can com­mu­nic­ate them. We are there­fore acting entirely within our rights in study­ing the sub­sequent traces and con­sequences of this emo­tional field in per­sons in whom these devel­op­mental pro­cesses show a par­tic­u­larly clear, or even exag­ger­ated, growth. Patho­logy, as you know, has always assisted us, by isol­a­tion and exag­ger­a­tion, in making recog­nis­able things which would nor­mally remain hidden. And since our researches have been car­ried out on people who are by no means grossly abnor­mal, we may, I think, con­sider the res­ults of them worthy of belief.</p>
<p>We will now turn our atten­tion to the ques­tion of why this strong attach­ment of the girl to her mother comes to grief. We are aware that that is what usu­ally hap­pens to it; it is fated to give way to an attach­ment to her father. And here we stumble on a fact which points in the right dir­ec­tion. This step in devel­op­ment is not merely a ques­tion of a change of object. The turn­ing away from the mother occurs in an atmo­sphere of ant­ag­on­ism; the attach­ment to the mother ends in hate. Such a hatred may be very marked and may per­sist through­out an entire life­time; it may later on be care­fully over­com­pensated; as a rule, one part of it is over­come, while another part per­sists. The out­come is nat­ur­ally very strongly influ­enced by the actual events of later years. We will con­fine ourselves to study­ing this hatred at the actual time at which the turn towards the father takes place, and to inquir­ing into its motives. We are then met by a long list of com­plaints and griev­ances, lev­elled at the mother, which are inten­ded to jus­tify the ant­ag­on­istic feel­ings of the child; they vary much in value, and we shall exam­ine them fur­ther. Many are obvi­ous ration­al­isa­tions, and we have yet to find the true source of the ant­ag­on­ism. I hope you will bear with me, if on this occa­sion I con­duct you through all the details of a psycho-ana­lyt­ical invest­ig­a­tion.</p>
<p>The com­plaint against the mother that harks back fur­thest, is that she has given the child too little milk, which is taken as indic­at­ing a lack of love. Now this com­plaint has a cer­tain jus­ti­fic­a­tion in the civ­il­ised human family. The moth­ers often have not enough nour­ish­ment for their chil­dren, and con­tent them­selves with nurs­ing them for nine months or six or even less. Among prim­it­ive peoples chil­dren remain at the breast for as long as two or three years. The figure of the wet-nurse is as a rule merged in that of the mother; where this does not take place, the com­plaint against the mother takes another form, namely, that she sent the nurse, who was so ready to feed the child, away too soon. But whatever may have been the true state of affairs, it is impossible that the child’s com­plaint can be as often jus­ti­fied as it is met with. It looks far more as if the desire of the child for its first form of nour­ish­ment is alto­gether insa­ti­able, and as if it never got over the pain of losing the mother’s breast. I should not be at all sur­prised if an ana­lysis of a member of a prim­it­ive race, who must have sucked the mother’s breast when he could already run and talk, brought the same com­plaint to light. It is prob­able, too, that the fear of pois­on­ing is con­nec­ted with wean­ing. Poison is the nour­ish­ment that makes one ill. Per­haps, moreover, the child traces his early ill­nesses back to this frus­tra­tion. It requires a good deal of intel­lec­tual train­ing before we can believe in chance; prim­it­ive and uneducated people, and cer­tainly chil­dren, can give a reason for everything that hap­pens. Per­haps this reason was ori­gin­ally a motive (in the anim­istic sense). In many social strata, even to this day, no one can die, without having been done to death by some one else, prefer­ably by the doctor. And the reg­u­lar reac­tion of a neur­otic to the death of some one intim­ately con­nec­ted with him is to accuse him­self of being the cause of the death.</p>
<p>The next accus­a­tion against the mother flares up when the next child makes its appear­ance in the nurs­ery. If pos­sible this com­plaint retains the con­nec­tion with oral frus­tra­tion: the mother could not or would not give the child any more milk, because she needed the nour­ish­ment for the new arrival. In cases where the two chil­dren were born so close together that lacta­tion was interfered with by the second preg­nancy, this com­plaint has a real found­a­tion. It is a remark­able fact that even when the dif­fer­ence between the chil­dren’s ages is only eleven months, the older one is nev­er­the­less able to take in the state of affairs. But it is not only the milk that the child grudges the undesired inter­loper and rival, but all the other evid­ences of moth­erly care. It feels that it has been dethroned, robbed and had its rights invaded, and so it dir­ects a feel­ing of jeal­ous hatred against its little brother or sister, and devel­ops resent­ment against its faith­less mother, which often finds expres­sion in a change for the worse in its beha­viour. It begins to be ‘naughty,’ irrit­able, intract­able, and unlearns the con­trol which it has acquired over its excre­tions. All this has been known for a long time, and is accep­ted as self-evid­ent, but we seldom form a right idea of the strength of these jeal­ous impulses, of the ten­a­cious hold they have on the child, and the amount of influ­ence they exert on its later devel­op­ment. These jeal­ous feel­ings are par­tic­u­larly import­ant because they are always being fed anew during the later years of child­hood, and the whole shat­ter­ing exper­i­ence is repeated with the arrival of every new brother or sister. Even if the child remains its mother’s favour­ite, things are not very dif­fer­ent; its demands for affec­tion are bound­less; it requires exclus­ive atten­tion and will allow no shar­ing whatever.</p>
<p>A potent source of the child’s ant­ag­on­ism against its mother is found in its many sexual wishes, which change with its libid­inal phases. These cannot, for the most part, be sat­is­fied. The strongest of these frus­tra­tions occurs in the phal­lic stage, when the mother for­bids pleas­ur­able activ­it­ies cent­ring round the gen­ital organs—often with an accom­pani­ment of harsh threats and every indic­a­tion of dis­ap­proval—activ­it­ies to which, after all, she her­self stim­u­lated the child. It might be thought that we had here motives enough for the little girl’s ali­en­a­tion from her mother. In that case it might be our view that estrange­ment fol­lows inev­it­ably from the nature of infant­ile sexu­al­ity, from the child’s unlim­ited demands for love and the unful­fil­lable nature of its sexual wishes. One might even believe that this first love rela­tion of the child is doomed to extinc­tion for the very reason that it is the first, for these early object-cathexes are always ambi­val­ent to a very high degree; along­side the child’s intense love there is always a strong aggress­ive tend­ency present, and the more pas­sion­ately the child loves an object, the more sens­it­ive it will be to dis­ap­point­ments and frus­tra­tions coming from it. In the end, the love is bound to capit­u­late to the accu­mu­lated hos­til­ity. Or, on the other hand, one might reject the idea of a fun­da­mental ambi­val­ence of this kind in the libid­inal cathexes, and point to the fact that it is the pecu­liar nature of the mother-child rela­tion­ship which leads, equally inev­it­ably, to the dis­turb­ance of the child’s love, since even the mild­est form of edu­ca­tion cannot avoid using com­pul­sion and intro­du­cing restric­tions, and every such encroach­ment on its free­dom must call forth as a reac­tion in the child a tend­ency to rebel­lion and aggress­ive­ness. A dis­cus­sion of these pos­sib­il­it­ies might, I think, be very inter­est­ing, but at this point an objec­tion sud­denly arises, which forces our atten­tion in another dir­ec­tion. All of these factors—slights, dis­ap­point­ments in love, jeal­ousy and seduc­tion fol­lowed by pro­hib­i­tion—oper­ate as well in the rela­tion­ship between the boy and his mother, and yet are not suf­fi­cient to ali­en­ate him from the mother-object. If we do not find some­thing which is spe­cific for the girl, and which is not present at all, or not present in the same way in the case of the boy, we shall not have explained the ending of the girl attach­ment to her mother.</p>
<p>I think that we have dis­covered this spe­cific factor, in a place where we might indeed have expec­ted it, but in a sur­pris­ing form. In a place where we might have expec­ted it, I say, for it lies in the cas­tra­tion com­plex. The ana­tom­ical dis­tinc­tion between the sexes must, after all, leave its mark in mental life. It was a sur­prise, how­ever, to dis­cover from ana­lyses that the girl holds her mother respons­ible for her lack of a penis, and never for­gives her for that defi­ciency.</p>
<p>You will note that we ascribe a cas­tra­tion-com­plex to the female sex as well as to the male. We have good grounds for doing so, but that com­plex has not the same con­tent in girls as in boys. In the boy the cas­tra­tion-com­plex is formed after he has learnt from the sight of the female gen­it­als that the sexual organ which he prizes so highly is not a neces­sary part of every human body. He remem­bers then the threats which he has brought on him­self by his play­ing with his penis, he begins to believe in them, and thence for­ward he comes under the influ­ence of <em>cas­tra­tion-anxi­ety</em>, which sup­plies the strongest motive force for his fur­ther devel­op­ment. The cas­tra­tion-com­plex in the girl, as well, is star­ted by the sight of the gen­ital organs of the other sex. She imme­di­ately notices the dif­fer­ence, and—it must be admit­ted—its sig­ni­fic­ance. She feels her­self at a great dis­ad­vant­age, and often declares that she would ‘like to have some­thing like that too,’ and falls a victim to <em>penis-envy</em>, which leaves inerad­ic­able traces on her devel­op­ment and char­ac­ter-form­a­tion, and, even in the most favour­able instances, is not over­come without a great expendit­ure of mental energy. That the girl recog­nises the fact that she lacks a penis, does not mean that she accepts its absence lightly. On the con­trary, she clings for a long time to the desire to get some­thing like it, and believes in that pos­sib­il­ity for an extraordin­ary number of years; and even at a time when her know­ledge of real­ity has long since led her to aban­don the ful­fil­ment of this desire as being quite unat­tain­able, ana­lysis proves that it still per­sists in the uncon­scious, and retains a con­sid­er­able charge of energy. The desire after all to obtain the penis for which she so much longs may even con­trib­ute to the motives that impel a grown-up woman to come to ana­lysis; and what she quite reas­on­ably expects to get from ana­lysis, such as the capa­city to pursue an intel­lec­tual career, can often be recog­nised as a sub­lim­ated modi­fic­a­tion of this repressed wish.</p>
<p>One cannot very well doubt the import­ance of penis-envy. Per­haps you will regard the hypo­thesis that envy and jeal­ousy play a greater part in the mental life of women than they do in that of men as an example of male unfair­ness. Not that I think that these char­ac­ter­ist­ics are absent in men, or that they have no other origin in women except envy of the penis, but I am inclined to ascribe the greater amount of them to be found in women to this latter influ­ence. Many ana­lysts, how­ever, tend to min­im­ize the import­ance of this first wave of penis-envy in the phal­lic phase. They think that the signs one comes across of this atti­tude in women are in the main a sec­ond­ary form­a­tion, which has come about through regres­sion to the early infant­ile impulse in ques­tion on the occa­sion of some sub­sequent con­flict. Now this is one of the gen­eral prob­lems of depth psy­cho­logy. In the case of many patho­lo­gical—or merely unusual—instinctual atti­tudes, for example with all sexual per­ver­sions, the ques­tion arises how much of their force is to be attrib­uted to early infant­ile fix­a­tions and how much to the influ­ence of later exper­i­ences and devel­op­ments. It is almost always a ques­tion of com­ple­mental series, such as we have pos­tu­lated when deal­ing with the aeti­ology of the neur­oses. Both sets of factors share in the caus­a­tion in a vary­ing pro­por­tion; a less in the one set will be bal­anced by a more in the other. The infant­ile factor in every case paves the way; it is not always the decis­ive force, though it often is. But with regard to the par­tic­u­lar case of penis-envy, I should like to come down decidedly in favour of the pre­pon­der­ance of the infant­ile factor.</p>
<p>The dis­cov­ery of her cas­tra­tion is a turn­ing-point in the life of the girl. Three lines of devel­op­ment diverge from it; one leads to sexual inhib­i­tion or to neur­osis, the second to a modi­fic­a­tion of char­ac­ter in the sense of mas­culin­ity com­plex, and the third to normal fem­in­in­ity. We have learnt a good deal, though not everything, about all three. The fun­da­mental con­tent of the first is that the little girl, who has hitherto lived a mas­cu­line life, and has been able to obtain pleas­ure through the excit­a­tion of her clit­oris, and has con­nec­ted this beha­viour with the sexual wishes (often of an active char­ac­ter) which she has dir­ec­ted towards her mother, finds her enjoy­ment of phal­lic sexu­al­ity spoilt by the influ­ence of penis-envy. She is wounded in her self-love by the unfa­vour­able com­par­ison with the boy who is so much better equipped, and there­fore gives up the mas­turb­at­ory sat­is­fac­tion which she obtained from her clit­oris, repu­di­ates her love towards her mother, and at the same time often represses a good deal of her sexual impulses in gen­eral. No doubt this turn­ing away from her mother does not come to pass at one blow, for at first the girl looks on her cas­tra­tion as a per­sonal mis­for­tune, and only gradu­ally extends it to other females, and even­tu­ally to her mother. Her love had as its object the phal­lic mother; with the dis­cov­ery that the mother is cas­trated it becomes pos­sible to drop her as a love-object, so that the incent­ives to hos­til­ity which have been so long accu­mu­lat­ing, get the upper hand. This means, there­fore, that as a result of the dis­cov­ery of the absence of a penis, women are as much depre­ci­ated in the eyes of the girl as in the eyes of the boy, and later, per­haps, of the man.</p>
<p>You all know what an over­whelm­ing aeti­olo­gical import­ance is attrib­uted by neur­ot­ics to their mas­turb­at­ory prac­tices. They make them respons­ible for all their troubles, and we have the greatest dif­fi­culty in get­ting them to believe that they are wrong. But as a matter of fact we ought to admit that they are in the right, for mas­turb­a­tion is the exec­ut­ive agent of infant­ile sexu­al­ity, from the faulty devel­op­ment of which they are suf­fer­ing. The dif­fer­ence is that what the neur­ot­ics are blam­ing is the mas­turb­a­tion of the puber­tal stage; the infant­ile mas­turb­a­tion, which is the one that really mat­ters, has for the most part been for­got­ten by them. I wish I could find an oppor­tun­ity for giving you a cir­cum­stan­tial account of how import­ant all the fac­tual details of early mas­turb­a­tion are in determ­in­ing the sub­sequent neur­osis or char­ac­ter of the indi­vidual con­cerned—such details as whether it was dis­covered or not, how the par­ents com­bated it or whether they per­mit­ted it, and whether the sub­ject suc­ceeded in sup­press­ing it him­self. All these details will have left indelible traces upon his devel­op­ment. But in fact I am relieved that it is not neces­sary for me to do this; it would be a dif­fi­cult and weary task, and at the end you would embar­rass me because you would quite cer­tainly ask for some prac­tical advice as to how one should behave towards the mas­turb­a­tion of small chil­dren as a parent or edu­cator. The his­tory of the devel­op­ment of girls, which is the sub­ject I am telling you about, offers an instance of the child itself striv­ing to free itself from mas­turb­a­tion. But it does not always suc­ceed. Where penis-envy has aroused a strong impulse against clit­or­itic mas­turb­a­tion, but where the latter will not give way, there fol­lows a fierce battle for free­dom, in which the girl her­self takes over, as it were, the role of the mother whom she has set aside, and expresses her whole dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the inferior clit­oris, by striv­ing against the grat­i­fic­a­tion derived from it. Many years later, when her mas­turb­at­ory activ­ity has long ago been sup­pressed, we may find an interest per­sist­ing which we must inter­pret as a defence against the tempta­tion, which she still fears. It finds expres­sion in feel­ings of sym­pathy for per­sons to whom she ascribes sim­ilar dif­fi­culties; it may enter into her motives for mar­riage, and may indeed determ­ine her choice of a hus­band or lover. The set­tling of the prob­lem of infant­ile mas­turb­a­tion is truly no easy or unim­port­ant task.</p>
<p>When the little girl gives up clit­or­itic mas­turb­a­tion, she sur­renders a cer­tain amount of activ­ity. Her pass­ive side has now the upper hand, and in turn­ing to her father she is assisted in the main by pass­ive instinctual impulses. You will see that a step in devel­op­ment, such as this one, which gets rid of phal­lic activ­ity, must smooth the path for fem­in­in­ity. If in the pro­cess not too much is lost through repres­sion, this fem­in­in­ity may prove normal. The wish with which the girl turns to her father, is, no doubt, ulti­mately the wish for the penis, which her mother has refused her and which she now expects from her father. The fem­in­ine situ­ation is, how­ever, only estab­lished when the wish for the penis is replaced by the wish for a child—the child taking the place of the penis, in accord­ance with the old sym­bolic equa­tion. It does not escape us that at an earlier stage the girl has already desired a child, before the phal­lic phase was interfered with; that was the mean­ing of her play­ing with dolls. But this play was not really an expres­sion of her fem­in­in­ity, it served, in identi­fy­ing her with her mother, the pur­pose of sub­sti­tut­ing activ­ity for passiv­ity. She was the mother, and the doll was her­self; now she could do everything to the doll that her mother used to do with her. Only with the onset of the desire for a penis does the doll-child become a child by the father, and, thence­for­ward, the strongest fem­in­ine wish. Her hap­pi­ness is great indeed when this desire for a child one day finds a real ful­fil­ment; but espe­cially is this so if the child is a little boy, who brings the longed-for penis with him. In the idea of having a child by the father, the accent is often enough placed on the child, and not on the father. Thus the old mas­cu­line wish for the pos­ses­sion of a penis still shows under the com­pletely developed fem­in­in­ity. But per­haps we should rather think of this desire for a penis as some­thing essen­tially fem­in­ine in itself.</p>
<p>With the trans­fer­ence of the child-penis wish on to her father, the girl enters into the situ­ation of the Oed­ipus-com­plex. The hos­til­ity against her mother, which did not require to be newly cre­ated, now receives a great rein­force­ment, for her mother becomes a rival, who gets everything from her father that she her­self wants. The girl’s Oed­ipus-com­plex has long con­cealed from us the pre-oed­ipal attach­ment to her mother which is so import­ant and which leaves behind it such last­ing fix­a­tions. For the girl, the Oed­ipus situ­ation is the con­clu­sion of a long and dif­fi­cult period of devel­op­ment, it is a kind of tem­por­ary solu­tion of her prob­lem, a state of equi­lib­rium which is not lightly to be given up, espe­cially as the onset of the latency period is not far off. And here we notice a dif­fer­ence between the two sexes in the rela­tion between the Oed­ipus-com­plex and the cas­tra­tion-com­plex, a dif­fer­ence which is prob­ably a moment­ous one. The boy’s Oed­ipus-com­plex, in which he desires his mother, and wants to get rid of his father as a rival, devel­ops nat­ur­ally out of the phase of phal­lic sexu­al­ity. The threat of cas­tra­tion, how­ever, forces him to give up this atti­tude. Under the influ­ence of the danger of losing his penis, he aban­dons his Oed­ipus-com­plex; it is repressed and in the most normal cases entirely des­troyed, while a severe super-ego is set up as its heir. What hap­pens in the case of the girl is almost the oppos­ite. The cas­tra­tion-com­plex pre­pares the way for the Oed­ipus-com­plex instead of des­troy­ing it; under the influ­ence of her penis-envy the girl is driven from her attach­ment to her mother, and enters the Oed­ipus situ­ation, as though it were a haven of refuge. When the fear of cas­tra­tion dis­ap­pears, the primary motive is removed, which has forced the boy to over­come his Oed­ipus-com­plex. The girl remains in the Oed­ipus situ­ation for an indef­in­ite period, she only aban­dons it late in life, and then incom­pletely. The form­a­tion of the super-ego must suffer in these cir­cum­stances; it cannot attain the strength and inde­pend­ence which give it its cul­tural import­ance and fem­in­ists are not pleased if one points to the way in which this factor affects the devel­op­ment of the aver­age fem­in­ine char­ac­ter.</p>
<p>Let us now go back a little. We have men­tioned, as the second pos­sible reac­tion after the dis­cov­ery of female cas­tra­tion, the devel­op­ment of a strong mas­culin­ity com­plex. What is meant by this is that the girl refuses, as it were, to accept the unpal­at­able fact, and, in an out­burst of defi­ance, exag­ger­ates still fur­ther the mas­culin­ity which she has dis­played hitherto. She clings to her clit­or­itic activ­it­ies, and takes refuge in an iden­ti­fic­a­tion either with the phal­lic mother, or with the father. What is the determ­in­ant which leads to this state of affairs? We can pic­ture it as noth­ing other than a con­sti­tu­tional factor: the pos­ses­sion of a greater degree of activ­ity, such as is usu­ally char­ac­ter­istic of the male. The essen­tial thing about the pro­cess is, after all, that at this point of devel­op­ment the onset of passiv­ity, which makes pos­sible the change over to fem­in­in­ity, is avoided. The most extreme achieve­ment of this mas­culin­ity com­plex seems to occur when it influ­ences the girl’s object-choice in the dir­ec­tion of mani­fest homo­sexu­al­ity. Ana­lytic exper­i­ence teaches us, it is true, that female homo­sexu­al­ity is seldom or never a direct con­tinu­ation of infant­ile mas­culin­ity. It seems to be char­ac­ter­istic of female homo­sexu­als that they too take the father as love-object for a while, and thus become implic­ated in the Oed­ipus situ­ation. Then, how­ever, they are driven by the inev­it­able dis­ap­point­ments which they exper­i­ence from the father into a regres­sion to their early mas­culin­ity com­plex. One must not over­es­tim­ate the import­ance of these dis­ap­point­ments; girls who even­tu­ally achieve fem­in­in­ity also exper­i­ence them without the same res­ults. The pre­pon­der­ance of the con­sti­tu­tional factor seems undeni­able, but the two phases in the devel­op­ment of female homo­sexu­al­ity are admir­ably reflec­ted in the beha­viour of homo­sexu­als, who just as often and just as obvi­ously play the parts of mother and child towards each other as those of man and wife.</p>
<p>What I have been telling you is what one might call the pre-his­tory of women. It is an achieve­ment of the last few years, and you may have been inter­ested in it as an example of detailed work in ana­lysis. Since women are our theme, I am going to permit myself to men­tion by name a few women to whom this invest­ig­a­tion owes import­ant con­tri­bu­tions. Dr. Ruth Mack Brun­swick was the first to describe a case of neur­osis which went back to a fix­a­tion in the pre-oed­ipal state, and in which the Oed­ipus situ­ation was not reached at all. It took the form of para­noia with delu­sions of jeal­ousy, and proved access­ible to treat­ment. Dr. Jeanne Lamplde Groot has from her own unequi­vocal obser­va­tions estab­lished the fact of the girl’s phal­lic activ­it­ies towards her mother which seem so hard to believe. Dr. Helene Deutsch has shown that the erotic beha­viour of homo­sexual woman repro­duces the mother-child rela­tion­ship.</p>
<p>It is not my inten­tion to trace the fur­ther course of fem­in­in­ity through puberty up to the time of matur­ity. Our views on the sub­ject are indeed not com­plete enough for me to do so. In what fol­lows, I will merely men­tion a few sep­ar­ate points. Bear­ing in mind the early his­tory of fem­in­in­ity, I will emphas­ise the fact that its devel­op­ment remains open to dis­turb­ance from the traces left behind by the pre­vi­ous mas­cu­line period. Regres­sions to fix­a­tions at these pre-oed­ipal phases occur very often; in many women we actu­ally find a repeated altern­a­tion of peri­ods in which either mas­culin­ity or fem­in­in­ity has obtained the upper hand. What we men call ‘the enigma of woman’ is prob­ably based in part upon these signs of bi-sexu­al­ity in female life. But another ques­tion seems to have become ripe for dis­cus­sion in the course of these invest­ig­a­tions. We have called the motor force of sexual life ‘libido.’ This sexual life is dom­in­ated by the polar­ity, mas­cu­line-fem­in­ine; one is there­fore temp­ted to con­sider the rela­tion of the libido to this polar­ity. It would not be sur­pris­ing if it turned out that each form of sexu­al­ity had its own spe­cial form of libido, so that one kind of libido pur­sued the aims of the mas­cu­line sexual life, and the other those of the fem­in­ine. Noth­ing of the sort, how­ever, is the case. There is only one libido which is as much in the ser­vice of the male as of the female sexual func­tion. To it itself we can assign no sex; if, in accord­ance with the con­ven­tional ana­logy between activ­ity and mas­culin­ity, we choose to call it mas­cu­line, we must not forget that it also includes impulses with pass­ive aims. Nev­er­the­less the phrase ‘fem­in­ine libido’ cannot pos­sibly be jus­ti­fied. It is our impres­sion that more viol­ence is done to the libido when it is forced into the ser­vice of the female func­tion; and that—to speak tele­olo­gic­ally—Nature has paid less care­ful atten­tion to the demands of the female func­tion than to those of mas­culin­ity. And—again speak­ing tele­olo­gic­ally—this may be based on the fact that the achieve­ment of the bio­lo­gical aim is entrus­ted to the aggress­ive­ness of the male, and is to some extent inde­pend­ent of the co-oper­a­tion of the female.</p>
<p>The sexual fri­gid­ity of women, the fre­quency of which seems to con­firm this last point, is still a phe­nomenon which is insuf­fi­ciently under­stood. Some­times it is psy­cho­genic, and, if so, it is access­ible to influ­ence; but in other cases one is led to assume that it is con­sti­tu­tion­ally con­di­tioned or even partly caused by an ana­tom­ical factor.</p>
<p>I have prom­ised to put before you a few more of the mental char­ac­ter­ist­ics of mature fem­in­in­ity, as we find them in our ana­lyt­ical obser­va­tion. We do not claim for these asser­tions more than that they are true on the whole; and it is not always easy to dis­tin­guish between what is due to the influ­ence of the sexual func­tion and what to social train­ing. We attrib­ute to women a greater amount of nar­ciss­ism (and this influ­ences their object-choice) so that for them to be loved is a stronger need than to love. Their vanity is partly a fur­ther effect of penis-envy, for they are driven to rate their phys­ical charms more highly as a belated com­pens­a­tion for their ori­ginal sexual inferi­or­ity. Mod­esty, which is regarded as a fem­in­ine char­ac­ter­istic <em>par excel­lence</em>, but is far more a matter of con­ven­tion than one would think, was, in our opin­ion, ori­gin­ally designed to hide the defi­ciency in her gen­it­als. We do not forget that, later on, it takes over other func­tions. People say that women con­trib­uted but little to the dis­cov­er­ies and inven­tions of civil­isa­tion, but per­haps after all they did dis­cover one tech­nical pro­cess, that of plait­ing and weav­ing. If this is so, one is temp­ted to guess at the uncon­scious motive at the back of this achieve­ment. Nature her­self might be regarded as having provided a model for imit­a­tion, by caus­ing pubic hair to grow at the period of sexual matur­ity so as to veil the gen­it­als. The step that remained to be taken was to attach the hairs per­man­ently together, whereas in the body they are fixed in the skin and only tangled with one another. If you repu­di­ate this idea as being fant­astic, and accuse me of having an <em>idée fixe</em> on the sub­ject of the influ­ence exer­cised by the lack of a penis upon the devel­op­ment of fem­in­in­ity, I cannot of course defend myself.</p>
<p>The con­di­tions of object-choice in women are often enough made unre­cog­nis­able by social con­sid­er­a­tions. Where that choice is allowed to mani­fest itself freely, it often occurs accord­ing to the nar­ciss­istic ideal of the man whom the girl would have liked to be. If the girl has remained attached to her father, if that is to say she has remained in the Oed­ipus-com­plex, then she chooses accord­ing to a father-type. Since, when she turned from her mother to her father, the ant­ag­on­istic part of her ambi­val­ent feel­ings remained dir­ec­ted on to her mother, such a choice should ensure a happy mar­riage. But very often a factor emerges which in gen­eral imper­ils such solu­tions of the ambi­val­ence-con­flict. The ant­ag­on­ism which has been left behind may follow in the wake of the pos­it­ive attach­ment, and extend to the new object. The hus­band, who had in the first instance inher­ited his pos­i­tion from the father, comes in the course of time to inherit the pos­i­tion of the mother as well. In this way it may easily occur that the second part of a woman’s life is taken up with a struggle against her hus­band, just as the shorter earlier part was occu­pied with rebel­lion against her mother. After this reac­tion has been lived out, a second mar­riage may easily turn out far more sat­is­fact­or­ily. Another change in a woman’s nature, for which neither hus­band nor wife are pre­pared, may come about after the first child has been born. Under the influ­ence of her own moth­er­hood, her iden­ti­fic­a­tion with her mother may be revived (an iden­ti­fic­a­tion against which she has struggled up to the time of her mar­riage) and may attract to itself all the libido that she has at her dis­posal, so that the repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion may repro­duce an unhappy mar­riage of the par­ents. That the old factor of lack of penis has not even yet for­feited its power is seen in the dif­fer­ent reac­tions of the mother accord­ing to whether the child born is a son or a daugh­ter. The only thing that brings a mother undi­luted sat­is­fac­tion is her rela­tion to a son; it is quite the most com­plete rela­tion­ship between human beings, and the one that is the most free from ambi­val­ence. The mother can trans­fer to her son all the ambi­tion which she has had to sup­press in her­self, and she can hope to get from him the sat­is­fac­tion of all that has remained to her of her mas­culin­ity com­plex. Even a mar­riage is not firmly assured until the woman has suc­ceeded in making her hus­band into her child and in acting the part of a mother towards him.</p>
<p>The mother-iden­ti­fic­a­tion of the woman can be seen to have two levels, the pre-oed­ipal, which is based on the tender attach­ment to the mother and which takes her as a model, and the later one, derived from the Oed­ipus-com­plex, which tries to get rid of the mother and replace her in her rela­tion­ship with the father. Much of both remains over for the future. One is really jus­ti­fied in saying that neither is over­come to any adequate extent during the pro­cess of devel­op­ment. But the phase of tender pre-oed­ipal attach­ment is the decis­ive one; it paves the way for her acquis­i­tion of those char­ac­ter­ist­ics which will later enable her to play her part in the sexual func­tion adequately, and carry out her ines­tim­able social activ­it­ies. In this iden­ti­fic­a­tion, too, she acquires that attract­ive­ness for the man which kindles his oed­ipal attach­ment to his mother into love. Only what hap­pens so often is, that it is not he him­self who gets what he wanted, but his son. One forms the impres­sion that the love of man and the love of woman are sep­ar­ated by a psy­cho­lo­gical phase-dif­fer­ence.</p>
<p>It must be admit­ted that women have but little sense of justice, and this is no doubt con­nec­ted with the pre­pon­der­ance of envy in their mental life; for the demands of justice are a modi­fic­a­tion of envy; they lay down the con­di­tions under which one is will­ing to part with it. We say also of women that their social interests are weaker than those of men, and that their capa­city for the sub­lim­a­tion of their instincts is less. The former is no doubt derived from the unso­cial char­ac­ter which undoubtedly attaches to all sexual rela­tion­ships. Lovers find com­plete sat­is­fac­tion in each other, and even the family res­ists absorp­tion into wider organ­isa­tions. The capa­city for sub­lim­a­tion is sub­ject to the greatest indi­vidual vari­ations. In spite of this I cannot refrain from men­tion­ing an impres­sion which one receives over and over again in ana­lytic work. A man of about thirty seems a youth­ful, and, in a sense, an incom­pletely developed indi­vidual, of whom we expect that he will be able to make good use of the pos­sib­il­it­ies of devel­op­ment, which ana­lysis lays open to him. But a woman of about the same age fre­quently stag­gers us by her psy­cho­lo­gical rigid­ity and unchange­ab­il­ity. Her libido has taken up its final pos­i­tions, and seems power­less to leave them for others. There are no paths open to her for fur­ther devel­op­ment; it is as though the whole pro­cess had been gone through, and remained inac­cess­ible to influ­ence for the future; as though, in fact, the dif­fi­cult devel­op­ment which leads to fem­in­in­ity had exhausted all the pos­sib­il­it­ies of the indi­vidual. As thera­peut­ists we deplore this state of affairs, even when we are suc­cess­ful in remov­ing her suf­fer­ings by solv­ing her neur­otic con­flict.</p>
<p>That is all I had to say to you about the psy­cho­logy of women. It is admit­tedly incom­plete and frag­ment­ary, and some­times it does not sound alto­gether flat­ter­ing. You must not forget, how­ever, that we have only described women in so far as their natures are determ­ined by their sexual func­tion. The influ­ence of this factor is, of course, very far-reach­ing, but we must remem­ber that an indi­vidual woman may be a human being apart from this. If you want to know more about fem­in­in­ity, you must inter­rog­ate your own exper­i­ence, or turn to the poets, or else wait until Sci­ence can give you more pro­found and more coher­ent inform­a­tion.</p>

<h2>Explan­a­tions, Applic­a­tions And Ori­ent­a­tions, Lec­ture XXXIV</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­man</span>—May I for once, tired, as one might say, of dry topics, speak to you about mat­ters which have very little the­or­et­ical import­ance, but which will be of interest to you in so far as you are friend­lily dis­posed towards psycho-ana­lysis? Let us sup­pose that in a moment of idle­ness you take up a German or Amer­ican or Eng­lish novel, in which you expect to find a descrip­tion of men and con­di­tions as they are to-day. After read­ing a few pages you come upon the first men­tion of psycho-ana­lysis, and then soon after upon another, even though the con­text does not seem to require it. You must not ima­gine that this has any­thing to do with the applic­a­tion of ‘depth-psy­cho­logy,’ with a view to a better under­stand­ing of the char­ac­ters in the book or of their beha­viour (though, of course, there are quite ser­i­ous lit­er­ary works in which this is attemp­ted). No, such ref­er­ences are for the most part con­temp­tu­ous remarks, by means of which the author seeks to dis­play his wide read­ing or his intel­lec­tual superi­or­ity. And you will not always get the impres­sion that he really knows what he is talk­ing about. Or, again, you may go for your recre­ation to some social gath­er­ing; it need not neces­sar­ily be in Vienna. After a short time the con­ver­sa­tion will turn on psycho-ana­lysis, and you will hear a great vari­ety of people giving their opin­ion upon it, usu­ally in tones of dog­matic cer­tainty. This judg­ment is nearly always a derog­at­ory one, often abus­ive, and at the very least deris­ive. If you are so imprudent as to dis­close the fact that you know some­thing about the sub­ject, every one rushes up to you, and asks for inform­a­tion and explan­a­tions, until after a little time you are con­vinced that all these severe judg­ments had been made in the absence of any know­ledge; that hardly any of these adversar­ies have ever had a book about ana­lysis in their hands, or, if they have, that they have never been able to over­come the first res­ist­ance which people exper­i­ence on coming in con­tact with a new sub­ject.</p>
<p>You may per­haps expect that an intro­duc­tion to psycho-ana­lysis should give you some indic­a­tion of what argu­ments you should use in order to cor­rect these vulgar errors about ana­lysis, what books to recom­mend for those who want more know­ledge, or even what examples from your read­ing and exper­i­ence you should bring into the dis­cus­sion in order to alter the atti­tude of your inter­locutors. I beg you to do noth­ing of the sort. It would be quite use­less, and your wisest course would be to hide your better know­ledge alto­gether. If that is impossible, then restrict yourselves to saying that, so far as you know, psycho-ana­lysis is a spe­cial branch of sci­ence, that it is exceed­ingly dif­fi­cult to under­stand and to judge, that it is con­cerned with very ser­i­ous mat­ters, so that one cannot pass it off with a few jokes, and that it would be better to choose some other topic as a social pas­time. Of course you will not take part in any attempts at inter­pret­a­tion if imprudent people repeat their dreams, and you will resist the tempta­tion to curry favour for ana­lysis by giving accounts of cures that it has brought about.</p>
<p>You may, how­ever, raise the ques­tion why these people, whether they write books or make con­ver­sa­tion, should behave so badly, and you will incline to the view that the cause does not lie entirely with the people them­selves, but with psycho-ana­lysis as well. That is my opin­ion too; what you meet with in lit­er­at­ure and con­ver­sa­tion in the shape of pre­ju­dice is the after-effect of an earlier judg­ment, the judg­ment, namely, which the rep­res­ent­at­ives of offi­cial sci­ence have passed upon the young sci­ence of psycho-ana­lysis. I have already com­plained about it once before in a his­tor­ical survey of the sub­ject, and I shall not do so again—per­haps even that was once too often; but indeed there was no logical blun­der, no offence against decency and good taste which the sci­entific oppon­ents of psycho-ana­lysis did not permit them­selves in those days. It was a situ­ation such as actu­ally occurred in the middle ages, in which a wrong-doer, or even a mere polit­ical oppon­ent, was put in the pil­lory and exposed to the ill-treat­ment of the mob. And per­haps you do not fully real­ise how high up in our soci­ety the mob spirit extends, and to what lengths people will go when they feel that they are a part of a crowd and super­ior to per­sonal respons­ib­il­ity. At the begin­ning of those times I stood more or less alone, and I very soon saw that polem­ics would do no good, and that com­plaints and appeals to wor­thier minds were sense­less, since there were no courts before which one could plead one’s cause. That being so, I took another path; I made use of applied psycho-ana­lysis for the first time by explain­ing the beha­viour of the crowd as an expres­sion of the same res­ist­ance which I had to struggle against in my indi­vidual patients. I kept off all polem­ics, and influ­enced my fol­low­ers, as they gradu­ally gathered, to do the same. This mode of beha­viour was sat­is­fact­ory. The ban under which ana­lysis was placed in those days has since been lifted; but, just as a belief which has been given up lingers on as a super­sti­tion, just as a theory which sci­ence has aban­doned is pre­served as a pop­u­lar belief, so to-day the ori­ginal excom­mu­nic­a­tion of psycho-ana­lysis in sci­entific circles sur­vives in the mock­ing con­tempt of the writers and con­ver­sa­tion­al­ists. You will there­fore no longer be sur­prised at their beha­viour.</p>
<p>You must not, how­ever, expect the good news that the struggle is at an end, with the recog­ni­tion of ana­lysis as a sci­ence and its admis­sion as a sub­ject for uni­ver­sity study. There is no ques­tion of that; the battle is still going on, but in a more respect­able way. There is another new factor, and that is that in the sci­entific world a kind of buffer state has been formed between ana­lysis and its oppon­ents, con­sist­ing of people who will allow that there is some­thing in ana­lysis (and even believe in it, sub­ject to the most divert­ing reser­va­tions), but who, on the other hand, reject other parts of it, as they are eager to let every one know. What determ­ines their choice is not easy to guess. It seems to be a matter of per­sonal sym­path­ies. Some take objec­tion to sexu­al­ity, others to the uncon­scious; the exist­ence of sym­bol­ism seems to be par­tic­u­larly dis­liked. The cir­cum­stance that the struc­ture of psycho-ana­lysis, although unfin­ished, nev­er­the­less already pos­sesses a uni­fied organ­isa­tion from which one cannot select ele­ments accord­ing to one’s whim, seems not to enter the minds of these eclectics. When I con­sider these half or quarter fol­low­ers I never get the impres­sion from any of them that their rejec­tions are based on an exam­in­a­tion of the mater­ial. There are a great many dis­tin­guished men who fall into this cat­egory. They are cer­tainly to be excused on the ground that their time and their interests are devoted to other things, to the sub­jects, in fact, by the mas­tery of which they have achieved so much. But, that being so, would it not be better for them to reserve their judg­ments instead of taking sides so strongly? In the case of one of these great men, I once suc­ceeded in making a rapid con­ver­sion. He was a world-famous critic, who had fol­lowed con­tem­por­ary trends of thought with bene­vol­ent under­stand­ing and proph­etic vision. I only got to know him when he had already passed his eighti­eth year, but he was still fas­cin­at­ing in con­ver­sa­tion. You can easily guess to whom I am refer­ring. And it was not I who raised the sub­ject of psycho-ana­lysis. He began it by com­par­ing him­self in the most modest way with myself, saying: ‘I am only a lit­er­ary man, and you are a man of sci­ence and a dis­coverer. But there is one thing I should like to say to you: I have never had any sexual feel­ing for my mother!’ ‘But there’s no need at all for you to have been con­scious of it,’ was my reply, ‘such pro­cesses are uncon­scious in grown-up people.’ ‘Oh, so <em>that’s</em> your idea,’ he said, greatly relieved, and pressed my hand. We went on talk­ing for a few hours longer on the best of terms. I heard later that during the few remain­ing years of his life he repeatedly expressed him­self in friendly terms about ana­lysis, and liked to make use of what was for him a new word—‘repres­sion.’</p>
<p>A well-known saying enjoins us to learn from our enemies. I must own that I have never been able to manage it; but it occurred to me that it might be instruct­ive for you if I were to call up all the reproaches and objec­tions which the oppon­ents of psycho-ana­lysis have lev­elled at it, and then point out all the obvi­ous mis­rep­res­ent­a­tions and logical blun­ders which they con­tain. But on second thoughts I said to myself that it would not be at all inter­est­ing but wear­i­some and dis­agree­able, and would, in fact, be pre­cisely what I have taken such pains to avoid all these years. You will have to excuse me, there­fore, if I refrain from fol­low­ing up this line of thought any fur­ther and spare you the judg­ments of our so-called sci­entific oppon­ents. After all, we are here deal­ing almost exclus­ively with people whose sole claim to be heard rests on their impar­ti­al­ity—which they have pre­served by keep­ing away from the facts of psycho-ana­lysis. But I am aware that in other cases you will not let me get away so cheaply. You will point out that, after all, there are a great many people to whom my last remark does not apply. These people, you will say, have not kept away from ana­lyt­ical exper­i­ence; they have ana­lysed patients, they have per­haps even been ana­lysed them­selves, they were actu­ally my col­leagues for some time, and now they have come to other con­clu­sions, and formed other the­or­ies, on the basis of which they have left me and have foun­ded inde­pend­ent schools of psycho-ana­lysis. You will expect me to give some explan­a­tion of the pos­sib­il­ity and mean­ing of these dis­sent­ing move­ments which have occurred so fre­quently in the his­tory of ana­lysis.</p>
<p>Very well, then, I will try; but I shall only do it briefly, for it throws less light upon the nature of ana­lysis than you might expect. I am sure that what you think of first will be Adler’s Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy, which in Amer­ica, for example, is looked on as being equal in import­ance to our psycho-ana­lysis and as run­ning on par­al­lel lines, and is con­stantly men­tioned in the same breath with it. In real­ity Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy has very little to do with ana­lysis, but, for cer­tain his­tor­ical reas­ons, lives a sort of para­sitic exist­ence at its expense. The qual­i­fic­a­tions which we have pre­dic­ated for this group of oppon­ents only apply to the founders of Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy to a very lim­ited extent. The name itself is unsuit­able, and seems to be a product of embar­rass­ment; we cannot assent to any inter­fer­ence with its cor­rect applic­a­tion as mean­ing the oppos­ite of Group Psy­cho­logy; for the matter of that our own con­cern is, first and fore­most, the psy­cho­logy of the human indi­vidual. I am not going into an object­ive cri­ti­cism of Adler’s Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy to-day, for that is no part of my pro­gramme in these lec­tures; besides which, I have already made such an attempt else­where, and I have little occa­sion for alter­ing what I there said. I will, how­ever, give you an illus­tra­tion of the impres­sion it makes, by telling you of a small incid­ent which occurred to me in my pre-ana­lytic years.</p>
<p>In the neigh­bour­hood of the little Moravian town in which I was born and which I left as a child of three years old, there is a modest health resort, beau­ti­fully placed in a set­ting of green. During my school years I often spent my hol­i­days there. Some twenty years later the ill­ness of a near rel­at­ive of mine afforded me an oppor­tun­ity of seeing the place again. In a con­ver­sa­tion with the doctor in charge of the place, who had atten­ded my rel­at­ive, I enquired about his deal­ings with the—I believe—Slov­akian peas­ants, who were his only <em>cli­entèle</em> during the winter. He told me that his med­ical treat­ment was car­ried on in the fol­low­ing way. In his con­sult­ing hours the patients came into his room and formed up in a line. One after another they came for­ward and told him their com­plaints. One of them might have pains in the back, or a stom­ach-ache, or a feel­ing of tired­ness in the legs, etc. The doctor then examined him, and, when he had formed his con­clu­sions told him the dia­gnosis, which was in every case the same. He trans­lated the word to me, and what it amoun­ted to was: ‘bewitched.’ I was aston­ished, and asked whether the patients made no objec­tion to his saying the same thing to all of his patients. ‘Oh, no!’ he answered, ‘they are very much pleased; it is exactly what they expect. Each one as he goes back to his place in the line says to the others by his looks and ges­tures: “There’s a fellow who knows what’s what!”’ At that time I little thought in what cir­cum­stances I should meet with an ana­log­ous situ­ation.</p>
<p>For whether a person is a homo­sexual, or a nec­ro­phil­ist, or an anxi­ety-ridden hys­teric, or a shut-in obses­sional, or a raving madman—in every case the Indi­vidual Psy­cho­lo­gist of the Adlerian per­sua­sion will assign as the motive force of his con­di­tion the fact that he wants to assert him­self, to over-com­pensate for his inferi­or­ity, to be on top, and to move over from the fem­in­ine to the mas­cu­line line. We used to hear exactly the same kind of thing when we were young stu­dents at hos­pital. Hys­ter­ics, we were told, pro­duce their symp­toms in order to make them­selves inter­est­ing and to attract atten­tion to them­selves. It is extraordin­ary how these old pro­fundit­ies recur! But even at the time this little bit of psy­cho­logy did not seem to us to cover the prob­lem of hys­teria; it left unex­plained, for instance, why people who suffer from it do not make use of some means for the attain­ment of their ends. Some ele­ment of this doc­trine of the Indi­vidual Psy­cho­lo­gists must of course be cor­rect, though they regard this frag­ment­ary explan­a­tion as a com­plete one. The instinct of self-pre­ser­va­tion will attempt to turn every situ­ation to its own account; the ego will try to get some advant­age even out of being ill. In psycho-ana­lysis we call this the ‘sec­ond­ary gain from ill­ness.’ But indeed, when one thinks of the facts of mas­ochism, of the uncon­scious need for pun­ish­ment and of the neur­otic tend­ency to self-injury, all of which seem to imply the exist­ence of instinctual impulses which run counter to self-pre­ser­va­tion, one comes to ques­tion even the gen­eral valid­ity of the plat­it­ude on which the the­or­et­ical struc­ture of Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy is built. But, to the mass of man­kind, a theory like this must be exceed­ingly wel­come, which takes no com­plic­a­tions into account, which intro­duces no new and dif­fi­cult con­cepts, which knows noth­ing of the uncon­scious, which removes at a single blow the prob­lem of sexu­al­ity, that weighs so heav­ily on every­body, and which con­fines itself to reveal­ing the devices by means of which people try to make life com­fort­able. For the mass of man­kind are them­selves com­fort-loving; they require only a single reason to serve as an explan­a­tion, they are not grate­ful to sci­ence for its intric­a­cies, and they like to have simple answers given to their ques­tions and to feel that their prob­lems are settled once and for all. Once one sees how closely Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy approx­im­ates to the ful­fil­ment of these require­ments, one cannot help remem­ber­ing a couplet from <em>Wal­len­stein</em>:</p>

<p>Spe­cial­ist cri­ti­cism, which has been so uncom­prom­isingly opposed to psycho-ana­lysis, has, in gen­eral, handled Indi­vidual Psy­cho­logy with a velvet glove. It is, indeed, true that in Amer­ica one of the most dis­tin­guished psy­chi­at­rists pub­lished a paper against Adler, entitled ‘Enough,’ in which he gave strong expres­sion to his dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the ‘repe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion’ of the Indi­vidual Psy­cho­lo­gists. If others have behaved far more kindly, the oppos­i­tion to ana­lysis is largely respons­ible.</p>
<p>I need not say much about other schools that have split off from us. That such splits have occurred is no argu­ment for or against the truth of psycho-ana­lysis. You have only to think of the strong emo­tional factors which make it dif­fi­cult for many people to co-oper­ate with others or adopt a sub­or­din­ate pos­i­tion, and of the still greater dif­fi­culty which is embod­ied in the pro­verb: ‘<em>Quot capita tot sensus</em>.’ When the dif­fer­ences of opin­ion had gone beyond a cer­tain limit, the best thing to do was to part com­pany, and thence­for­ward to go dif­fer­ent ways, espe­cially if the the­or­et­ical dif­fer­ence involved an alter­a­tion in ana­lyt­ical tech­nique. Let us take, for example, an ana­lyst who thinks very little of the influ­ence of the patient’s past, and looks for the cause of a neur­osis exclus­ively in con­tem­por­ary motives and expect­a­tions dir­ec­ted towards the future. If that is so, he will also neg­lect the ana­lysis of the patient’s child­hood and start on an alto­gether dif­fer­ent tech­nique; and he will have to make up for the absence of the effects of child­hood-ana­lysis by increas­ing his own didactic influ­ence and by dir­ectly recom­mend­ing the adop­tion of cer­tain aims in life. We, for our part, would then say: ‘That may be a philo­sophy, but it is no longer ana­lysis.’ Or another ana­lyst may come to hold the view that the anxi­ety-exper­i­ence of birth is the root of all later neur­otic dis­turb­ances; in that case he may think it proper to restrict ana­lysis to the effects of this one exper­i­ence, and to prom­ise thera­peutic suc­cess after a three to four months’ treat­ment. You will observe that I have chosen two examples which pro­ceed from dia­met­ric­ally opposed premises. It is an almost uni­ver­sal char­ac­ter­istic of these ‘dis­sent­ing move­ments’ that each of them seizes upon one frag­ment out of the wealth of motives found in psycho-ana­lysis (such, for instance, as the instinct for the power, the eth­ical con­flict, the mother, gen­it­al­ity, etc.), and on the basis of this appro­pri­ation makes itself inde­pend­ent. If it seems to you that such seces­sions are com­moner to-day in the his­tory of psycho-ana­lysis than they are in any other move­ment of thought, I do not know whether I should agree with you. If it be so, we must attrib­ute the respons­ib­il­ity to the close rela­tion­ship between the­or­et­ical out­look and thera­peutic prac­tice, which is to be found in psycho-ana­lysis. Mere dif­fer­ences of opin­ion would be borne with for far longer. People like to accuse us psycho-ana­lysts of intol­er­ance. The only evid­ence of this dis­agree­able char­ac­ter­istic was pre­cisely our sep­ar­a­tion from people who thought dif­fer­ently from ourselves. Apart from that, we have taken no steps against them; on the con­trary, they are now in clover; they are far better off than before, because, in part­ing com­pany with us, they have in most cases got rid of one of the bur­dens under which we groan—the odium of infant­ile sexu­al­ity, for instance, or the ludicrous­ness of sym­bol­ism—and they are now regarded by the world at large as at all events semi-respect­able, which we, who remain behind, cannot even yet claim to be. It was they them­selves, moreover, who—except­ing for one note­worthy example—effected the sep­ar­a­tion.</p>
<p>And what more do you ask of us in the name of tol­er­ance? When any one has expressed an opin­ion that we hold to be fun­da­ment­ally false, do you wish us to speak to him like this? ‘Thank you so much for con­tra­dict­ing us. You have saved us from the danger of self-com­pla­cency, and have given us an oppor­tun­ity of prov­ing to the Amer­ic­ans that we really are as “broad­minded” as they could pos­sibly wish. We do not believe a word of what you say, but that does not matter. You are just as right as we are, in all prob­ab­il­ity. After all, who can ever know who is in the right? In spite of our dis­agree­ment you must allow us to put for­ward your views in our pub­lic­a­tions. And we hope that you on your part will be so kind as to sup­port ours although you dis­be­lieve in them.’ This will obvi­ously be the usage of the future in sci­entific circles, when the mis­ap­plic­a­tion of Ein­stein’s theory of relativ­ity has com­pletely won the day. It is true that for the moment we have not gone quite so far as that. We have con­fined ourselves, in the old-fash­ioned way, to put­ting for­ward only our own con­vic­tions; we expose ourselves to the danger of making mis­takes, for no one can avoid that, and we reject any­thing that con­tra­dicts our views. As to the right to change our opin­ions, if we think we have found some­thing better, we have made full use of it in psycho-ana­lysis.</p>
<p>One of the first applic­a­tions of psycho-ana­lysis was that we were able to under­stand the oppos­i­tion we had to meet on account of our psycho-ana­lytic activ­it­ies. Other applic­a­tions, of an object­ive nature, can lay claim to a more gen­eral interest. Our first inten­tion was, as you know, to under­stand the dis­turb­ances of the human mind, because an aston­ish­ing exper­i­ence had shown us that in this case under­stand­ing and cure go almost hand in hand and that a prac­tic­able path leads from the one to the other. And for a long time this was our only inten­tion. Then, how­ever, we came to recog­nise the close rela­tion­ship, in fact, the under­ly­ing iden­tity, sub­sist­ing between patho­lo­gical and so-called normal pro­cesses. So psycho-ana­lysis became ‘depth-psy­cho­logy’; and, since noth­ing that man makes or does can be under­stood without the aid of psy­cho­logy, the applic­a­tions of psycho-ana­lysis to numer­ous fields of know­ledge, and espe­cially to the mental sci­ences, came about auto­mat­ic­ally, forced them­selves on our atten­tion and deman­ded elab­or­a­tion. Unluck­ily the tasks which we now under­took brought us up against obstacles, which, lying as they do in the very nature of the situ­ation, have not yet been over­come. Such an applic­a­tion pre­sup­poses a tech­nical know­ledge which the ana­lyst does not pos­sess; while those who do pos­sess the know­ledge—the experts—do not know any­thing of ana­lysis, and per­haps do not want to know any­thing. The result has been that ana­lysts have entered the lists in such fields as those of myth­o­logy, the his­tory of civil­isa­tion, eth­no­logy, the sci­ence of reli­gion, etc., as ama­teurs, with a more or less adequate equip­ment, often col­lec­ted in a hurry. In those fields they were treated by the spe­cial­ists, who were estab­lished there, as no better than inter­lopers; and their meth­ods, as well as their find­ings, in so far as they attrac­ted any atten­tion at all, were, to begin with, rejec­ted. But the pos­i­tion is stead­ily improv­ing; in every field the number of people who study psycho-ana­lysis with a view to making use of it in their spe­cial researches is grow­ing, in the same way that col­on­ists take the place of pion­eers. Here we may expect a rich har­vest of new know­ledge. Applic­a­tions of psycho-ana­lysis are always con­firm­a­tions of it as well. In regions where sci­entific work is more remote from prac­tical activ­ity the inev­it­able dif­fer­ences of opin­ion will be less embittered.</p>
<p>I feel greatly temp­ted to take you through all the applic­a­tions of psycho-ana­lysis in the field of mental sci­ence. There are things which every one who has intel­lec­tual interests would think worth know­ing, and to hear no more for a time about abnor­mal­it­ies and ill­ness would give us a well-earned relief. But I must resist the tempta­tion; it would once more take us too far out­side the frame­work of these lec­tures, and, to tell you the truth, I should not be com­pet­ent to do it. It is true that I took the first step along some of these lines, but to-day I no longer com­mand a view over the whole field, and I should have to spend much time in study in order to grasp all that has been added since I made my first attempts. Those of you who are dis­ap­poin­ted by my refusal can make up for it by read­ing our journal, Imago, which is devoted to the non-med­ical applic­a­tions of ana­lysis.</p>
<p>There is one sub­ject, how­ever, that I cannot pass by so easily, though this is not because I have any spe­cial under­stand­ing of it or have done much work on it myself. On the con­trary, I have hardly ever occu­pied myself with it. But it is of immense import­ance, and rich in hopes for the future; per­haps, indeed, it is the most import­ant of all the activ­it­ies of ana­lysis. I refer to the applic­a­tion of psycho-ana­lysis to edu­ca­tion, to the up-bring­ing of the next gen­er­a­tion. I am at least glad to be able to say that my daugh­ter, Anna Freud, has made this her life-work, and is in this way making good my own neg­lect of the sub­ject. One can easily see the path that has led to this applic­a­tion of ana­lysis. When, during the treat­ment of an adult neur­otic, we tried to trace the determ­in­a­tion of his symp­toms, we were always led back into his early child­hood. A know­ledge of the later aeti­olo­gical factors was not suf­fi­cient either for our under­stand­ing of his con­di­tion or to effect a cure. The result was that we were forced to acquaint ourselves with the psy­cho­lo­gical pecu­li­ar­it­ies of the years of infancy; and we learnt a great many things which could not have been dis­covered except through ana­lysis, and were in a pos­i­tion to set right a number of gen­er­ally accep­ted beliefs about child­hood. We came to see that the first years of infancy (up to about the age of five) are, for a number of reas­ons, of spe­cial import­ance. This is, in the first place, because they con­tain the first expan­sion of sexu­al­ity, which leaves behind decis­ive determ­in­ants for the sexual life of matur­ity; and, in the second place, because the impres­sions of this period come up against an unformed and weak ego, upon which they act like trau­mas. The ego cannot defend itself against the emo­tional storms which they call forth except by repres­sion, and in this way it acquires in child­hood all its pre­dis­pos­i­tions to sub­sequent ill­nesses and dis­turb­ances of func­tion. We have come to real­ise that the dif­fi­culty of child­hood con­sists in the fact that the child has, in a short span of time, to make its own the acquis­i­tions of a cul­tural devel­op­ment which has exten­ded over tens of thou­sands of years; it has, that is, to attain instinctual con­trol and social adapt­a­tion, or, at any rate, their first ele­ments. It can only achieve a part of this alter­a­tion through its own devel­op­ment; a great deal must be forced upon it by edu­ca­tion. We are not in the least sur­prised that the child often per­forms its task only incom­pletely. A great many chil­dren in these early years pass through con­di­tions which may be com­pared with neur­oses, and this is cer­tainly true of all those who develop a mani­fest ill­ness later on. In not a few cases the neur­otic ill­ness does not wait till they are grown up, but breaks out in child­hood and is a source of great trouble to par­ents and doc­tors.</p>
<p>We have had no hes­it­a­tion in apply­ing ana­lytic ther­apy to such chil­dren as either dis­play unam­bigu­ous neur­otic symp­toms, or are on the way to an unfa­vour­able char­ac­ter-devel­op­ment. The anxi­ety expressed by oppon­ents of ana­lysis, that the child might be harmed by the pro­cess, has turned out to be quite unfoun­ded. The advant­age gained by this pro­ced­ure is that we have been able to con­firm in the living sub­ject what we have only inferred, as though from his­tor­ical doc­u­ments, in the case of adults. But the advant­ages gained by the chil­dren them­selves was most sat­is­fact­ory. It turned out that the child is a most favour­able sub­ject for ana­lytic ther­apy; suc­cesses were rad­ical and per­man­ent. Nat­ur­ally one has to make extens­ive alter­a­tions in the tech­nique of treat­ment which has been developed for adults when one is deal­ing with chil­dren. The child is, psy­cho­lo­gic­ally, a dif­fer­ent thing from the adult; it does not yet pos­sess a super-ego, it cannot make much use of the method of free asso­ci­ation, and trans­fer­ence plays a dif­fer­ent part with it, since its real par­ents are still there. The internal res­ist­ances, against which we have to fight in the case of adults, are in the case of chil­dren for the most part replaced by external dif­fi­culties. If the par­ents make them­selves into vehicles for the res­ist­ance, the aims of the ana­lysis and even the pro­cess of the ana­lysis itself, are often endangered. For this reason it is often neces­sary to com­bine a cer­tain amount of ana­lytic influ­en­cing of the par­ents with the ana­lysis of the chil­dren. On the other hand, the inev­it­able dif­fer­ences between child ana­lysis and adult ana­lysis are dimin­ished by the fact that many of our patients have still kept so many of their infant­ile char­ac­ter-traits that the ana­lyst, once more adapt­ing him­self to his patient, cannot avoid making use of cer­tain parts of the tech­nique of child ana­lysis in their case too. It is in the nature of things that child ana­lysis should have become the spe­cial field of women ana­lysts, and this will no doubt con­tinue to be so.</p>
<p>The view that the major­ity of our chil­dren pass through a neur­otic phase in the course of their devel­op­ment auto­mat­ic­ally raises a hygienic ques­tion. It may be asked whether it would not be advant­age­ous to come to the aid of a child with ana­lysis even where there is no sign of a dis­turb­ance, as a pre­cau­tion­ary meas­ure in the interests of its health, just as nowadays one inocu­lates healthy chil­dren against diph­theria, without wait­ing for them to fall ill of the dis­ease. The dis­cus­sion of this ques­tion is to-day only a matter of aca­demic interest. I can ven­ture to speak about it to you; but the greater number of our con­tem­por­ar­ies would regard the mere idea as noth­ing short of crim­inal, and, when one con­siders the atti­tude of most par­ents towards ana­lysis, one must, as yet, give up any hope of its real­isa­tion. Such a pro­phy­lactic against nervous dis­ease, which would prob­ably be very effect­ive, pre­sup­poses an entirely dif­fer­ent struc­ture of soci­ety. The applic­a­tion of psycho-ana­lysis to edu­ca­tion must be looked for to-day in quite a dif­fer­ent dir­ec­tion. Let us get a clear idea of what the primary busi­ness of edu­ca­tion is. The child has to learn to con­trol its instincts. To grant it com­plete free­dom, so that it obeys all its impulses without any restric­tion, is impossible. It would be a very instruct­ive exper­i­ment for child-psy­cho­lo­gists, but it would make life impossible for the par­ents and would do ser­i­ous damage to the chil­dren them­selves, as would be seen partly at the time, and partly during sub­sequent years. The func­tion of edu­ca­tion, there­fore, is to inhibit, forbid and sup­press, and it has at all times car­ried out this func­tion to admir­a­tion. But we have learnt from ana­lysis that it is this very sup­pres­sion of instincts that involves the danger of neur­otic ill­ness. You will remem­ber that we have gone into the ques­tion of how this comes about in some detail. Edu­ca­tion has there­fore to steer its way between the Scylla of giving the instincts free play and the Charyb­dis of frus­trat­ing them. Unless the prob­lem is alto­gether insol­uble, an optimum of edu­ca­tion must be dis­covered, which will do the most good and the least harm. It is a matter of find­ing out how much one may forbid, at which times and by what meth­ods. And then it must fur­ther be con­sidered that the chil­dren have very dif­fer­ent con­sti­tu­tional dis­pos­i­tions, so that the same edu­ca­tional pro­ced­ure cannot pos­sibly be equally good for all chil­dren. A moment’s con­sid­er­a­tion will show us that, so far, edu­ca­tion has ful­filled its func­tion very badly, and has done chil­dren ser­i­ous injury. If we can find an optimum of edu­ca­tion which will carry out its task ideally, then we may hope to abol­ish one of the factors in the aeti­ology of neur­otic ill­ness, viz., the influ­ence of acci­dental infant­ile trau­mas. The other factor, the power of a refract­ory instinctual con­sti­tu­tion, can never be got rid of by edu­ca­tion. When, there­fore, one comes to think of the dif­fi­cult tasks with which the edu­cator is con­fron­ted; when one reflects that he has to recog­nise the char­ac­ter­istic con­sti­tu­tion of each child, to guess from small indic­a­tions what is going on in its unformed mind, to give him the right amount of love and at the same time to pre­serve an effect­ive degree of author­ity, then one cannot help saying to one-self that the only adequate pre­par­a­tion for the pro­fes­sion of edu­cator is a good ground­ing in psycho-ana­lysis. The best thing would be for him to be ana­lysed him­self, for, after all, without per­sonal exper­i­ence one cannot get a grasp of ana­lysis. The ana­lysis of teach­ers and edu­cat­ors seems to be a more prac­tic­able pro­phy­lactic meas­ure than the ana­lysis of chil­dren them­selves; and there are not such great obstacles against put­ting it into prac­tice.</p>
<p>I will only men­tion, in passing, an indir­ect advant­age which ana­lysis may bring to the edu­ca­tion of chil­dren, an advant­age which may even­tu­ally come to have con­sid­er­able import­ance. Par­ents who have exper­i­enced an ana­lysis them­selves, and who have derived much bene­fit from it, among other things an insight into the mis­takes in their own upbring­ing, will treat their chil­dren with better under­stand­ing, and will spare them a great deal which they were not spared them­selves. Par­al­lel with the efforts of the ana­lyst to influ­ence edu­ca­tion, run other invest­ig­a­tions into the cause and pre­ven­tion of delin­quency and crim­in­o­logy. Here again I shall only open the door and show you what lies behind it, but I shall not take you inside. If your interest in psycho-ana­lysis is main­tained, you will be able to learn a great deal that is both new and valu­able on these sub­jects. I cannot, how­ever, leave the theme of edu­ca­tion without men­tion­ing one par­tic­u­lar point of view. It has been said—and no doubt with justice—that every edu­ca­tion is par­tisan; it aims at making the child adapt itself to whatever social system is the estab­lished one, without con­sid­er­a­tion of how valu­able or how stable that system may be. If, it is argued, one is con­vinced of the short­com­ings of our present-day social arrange­ments, one cannot think it right to give them the added sup­port of this psycho-ana­lyt­ical edu­ca­tion of ours. We must place before it another and a higher aim, one which is eman­cip­ated from the social stand­ards that are dom­in­ant to-day. I do not feel, how­ever, that this argu­ment is valid. It is demand­ing more of ana­lysis than its func­tions can jus­tify. The phys­i­cian who is called in to treat a case of pneu­mo­nia has no need to con­sider whether the patient is a good man, a sui­cide, or a crim­inal; whether he deserves to remain alive, or whether it is for his advant­age to do so. This other aim which it is sought to place before edu­ca­tion would be a par­tisan one as well, and it is not the busi­ness of the ana­lyst to decide between parties. I am not now con­sid­er­ing the fact that people will refuse to allow psycho-ana­lysis to have any influ­ence at all on edu­ca­tion if it con­fesses to aims which are incom­pat­ible with the exist­ing social order. Psy­cho­ana­lytic edu­ca­tion will be assum­ing an unwar­ran­ted respons­ib­il­ity if it sets out to make its pupils into revolu­tion­ar­ies. It will have done its task if it sends them away as healthy and as effi­cient as pos­sible. There are enough revolu­tion­ary ele­ments con­tained within itself to ensure that no one brought up under its influ­ence will in later life be on the side of reac­tion and sup­pres­sion. I should go so far as to say that revolu­tion­ary chil­dren are not desir­able from any point of view.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—I shall con­clude by saying a few words on the thera­peutic aspect of psycho-ana­lysis. I dis­cussed the the­or­et­ical side of the sub­ject fif­teen years ago, and I cannot for­mu­late it in any other way to-day; but I will say some­thing about the prac­tical exper­i­ence which we have had with it during the inter­val. You know, of course, that psycho-ana­lysis orgin­ated as a thera­peutic pro­ced­ure; it has gone far beyond that, but it has never given up its ori­ginal field of work, and it still relies upon con­tact with clin­ical mater­ial for its fur­ther advances and devel­op­ment. The accu­mu­la­tion of empir­ical data upon which we base our the­or­ies can be obtained in no other way. Our thera­peutic fail­ures are con­stantly set­ting us new tasks, and the require­ments of real life are an effi­cient pro­tec­tion against car­ry­ing to excess the spec­u­la­tion, which we, nev­er­the­less, cannot avoid in our work. I have already, in my former lec­tures, given an account of the means by which psycho-ana­lysis helps the patient, and along what lines; to-day we will con­sider to what extent it suc­ceeds.</p>
<p>You are per­haps aware that I have never been a thera­peutic enthu­si­ast; and there is no danger of my using this as an oppor­tun­ity for ringing the praises of ana­lysis in this respect. I would rather say too little than too much. At a time when I was still the only ana­lyst, people who were appar­ently kindly dis­posed to my opin­ions used to say to me: ‘That is all very nice and clever; but show me a case that you have cured by ana­lysis.’ This was one of the many for­mu­las that suc­ceeded one another, as time went on, whose func­tion it was to put the incon­veni­ent nov­elty on one side. To-day it is as out of date as many others; the ana­lyst, like any other thera­peut­ist, has his col­lec­tion of let­ters of grat­it­ude from patients who have been cured. And the ana­logy does not end there. Psycho-ana­lysis really is a form of ther­apy, just as other meth­ods are. It has its tri­umphs, its defeats, its dif­fi­culties, its lim­it­a­tions and its indic­a­tions. There was a time when people attacked ana­lysis with the accus­a­tion that it was not to be taken ser­i­ously as a ther­apy, because it did not ven­ture to pub­lish any stat­ist­ics of its suc­cesses. Since then the Insti­tute of Psycho-Ana­lysis in Berlin, which was foun­ded by Dr. Max Eitin­gon, has pub­lished a report of its work during the first ten years of its exist­ence. The pro­por­tion of recov­er­ies which have been effected give us ground neither for boast­ing nor for feel­ing ashamed. But such stat­ist­ics are not instruct­ive, because the mater­ial with which they deal is so het­ero­gen­eous that it would need a very large number of cases to prove any­thing. It is better to exam­ine one’s own indi­vidual exper­i­ence. As to that, I may say that I do not think our suc­cesses can com­pete with those of Lourdes. There are so many more people who believe in the mir­acles of the Blessed Virgin than in the exist­ence of the uncon­scious. But if we dis­reg­ard super­nat­ural com­pet­i­tion, we must com­pare psycho-ana­lysis with other meth­ods of psycho-ther­apy. Nowadays one need hardly take into con­sid­er­a­tion organic phys­ical treat­ment of neur­otic con­di­tions. As a psycho-thera­peutic method, ana­lysis does not stand in oppos­i­tion to other meth­ods employed in this branch of medi­cine; it does not inval­id­ate them nor does it exclude them. There would be no the­or­et­ical objec­tion to a phys­i­cian who described him­self as a psycho-thera­peut­ist using ana­lysis upon his patients along­side other thera­peutic meth­ods, accord­ing to the pecu­liar char­ac­ter of the case and the favour­able or unfa­vour­able nature of the cir­cum­stances. In actual fact, it is the ques­tion of tech­nique which renders neces­sary the spe­cial­isa­tion of med­ical prac­tice. So, for example, it became neces­sary to sep­ar­ate sur­gery and ortho­paed­ics. The prac­tice of psycho-ana­lysis is dif­fi­cult and exact­ing! It cannot well be dealt with like a pair of spec­tacles, which can be put on for read­ing and taken off when one wants to go for a walk. As a rule psycho-ana­lysis either pos­sesses the doctor entirely or not at all. The psycho-thera­peut­ists who occa­sion­ally make use of ana­lysis do not, as far as my exper­i­ence goes, stand on a firm ana­lyt­ical basis; they have not accep­ted ana­lysis as a whole, but have watered it down, and per­haps removed its ‘sting’; they cannot be coun­ted as ana­lysts. In my opin­ion this is to be regret­ted; but a co-oper­a­tion in med­ical prac­tice between an ana­lyst and a psycho-thera­peut­ist who limits him­self to other meth­ods, would be alto­gether advant­age­ous.</p>
<p>Com­pared with other psycho-thera­peutic pro­ced­ures, psycho-ana­lysis is far and away the most power­ful. That is quite as it should be since it costs the most trouble and time, and one would not make use of it for slight cases; in suit­able cases one can remove dis­turb­ances, and bring about alter­a­tions which could not be hoped for in pre-ana­lytic times. But it has also per­fectly clearly felt lim­it­a­tions. The thera­peutic ambi­tions of many of my fol­low­ers have led them to be at great pains to remove such hindrances, so that all neur­otic dis­turb­ances might be cur­able by means of psycho-ana­lysis. They have attemp­ted to com­press the work of ana­lysis into a shorter period, to intensify the trans­fer­ence so that it should be super­ior to any res­ist­ance, and to com­bine other meth­ods of influ­ence with ana­lysis in order to obtain a cure. These enter­prises are no doubt praise­worthy, but in my opin­ion they are in vain. They also involve the danger of one­self being drawn away from ana­lysis and of drift­ing into a bound­less sea of exper­i­ment­a­tion. The expect­a­tion that we shall be able to cure all neur­otic symp­toms is, I sus­pect, derived from the lay belief that neur­oses are entirely super­flu­ous things which have no right whatever to exist. As a matter of fact they are ser­i­ous, con­sti­tu­tion­ally determ­ined affec­tions, which are seldom restric­ted to a few out­breaks, but make them­selves felt as a rule over long peri­ods of life, or even through­out its entire extent. Our ana­lytic exper­i­ence that we can influ­ence them to a far-reach­ing degree, if we can get hold of the his­tor­ical pre­cip­it­at­ing causes and the incid­ental access­ory factors, has made us neg­lect the con­sti­tu­tional factor in our thera­peutic prac­tice. And we are in fact power­less to deal with it; but in our theory we ought always to bear it in mind. In any case, the com­plete inac­cess­ib­il­ity of the psychoses to ana­lytic ther­apy should, in view of their close rela­tion­ship to the neur­oses, mod­er­ate our optim­ism in regard to the latter. The thera­peutic effi­ciency of psycho-ana­lysis is lim­ited by a whole series of import­ant factors, which can scarcely be dealt with at all. With chil­dren, where one might hope to have the greatest suc­cesses, there are the external dif­fi­culties of the par­ental situ­ation; yet after all these are bound up with the very fact of being a child. With adults we are primar­ily con­cerned with two factors, the degree of their mental rigid­ity and the form of their dis­ease with all the deeper-seated determ­in­ants that lie behind it. The former of these is often unjus­ti­fi­ably over­looked. How­ever great the plas­ti­city of mental life may be, and how­ever great the pos­sib­il­ity of reviv­ing past states, not everything can be brought to life again. A great many alter­a­tions seem final, and cor­res­pond to scars left behind by pro­cesses which have run their course. In other cases one gets an impres­sion of a gen­eral rigid­ity of the whole mind; mental pro­cesses, which one could very well redir­ect into other chan­nels, seem incap­able of leav­ing their old courses. But per­haps this is the same as what we have said already, but looked at from another point of view. Only too often one seems to see that the thera­peutic pro­cess is merely lack­ing in the neces­sary motive force to enable it to bring about the alter­a­tion. Some spe­cific tend­ency, some par­tic­u­lar instinctual com­pon­ent, is too strong in com­par­ison with the counter-forces that we can mobil­ize against it. This is quite gen­er­ally so in the case of the psychoses. We under­stand them in so far as we know quite well where we ought to apply the levers, but they are not able to lift the weight. In this con­nec­tion we may hope that in the future our know­ledge of the action of hor­mones—you know, of course, what they are—will provide us with a means of coping suc­cess­fully with the quant­it­at­ive factors involved in these dis­eases; but to-day we are far from having reached that desir­able goal. I can under­stand that the uncer­tainty pre­vail­ing in all these mat­ters is a con­stant incent­ive towards per­fect­ing the tech­nique of ana­lysis, espe­cially in the matter of the trans­fer­ence. The begin­ner in ana­lysis, in par­tic­u­lar, will be in doubt, when he is unsuc­cess­ful, whether he ought to blame the pecu­li­ar­ity of the case or his own unskil­ful hand­ling of the thera­peutic pro­ced­ure. But, as I have said already, I do not think that there is much to be gained by dir­ect­ing one’s ener­gies along these chan­nels.</p>
<p>The other lim­it­a­tion to ana­lyt­ical suc­cesses is imposed by the form of the dis­ease. You know already that the field in which ana­lyt­ical ther­apy can be applied is that of the trans­fer­ence-neur­oses, pho­bias, hys­terias, obses­sional neur­oses, and besides these such abnor­mal­it­ies of char­ac­ter as have been developed instead of these dis­eases. Everything other than these, such as nar­ciss­istic or psychotic con­di­tions, is more or less unsuit­able. Now it would be per­fectly legit­im­ate to save one­self from fail­ures by care­fully exclud­ing such cases. If this pre­cau­tion were taken, the stat­ist­ics of ana­lysis would be very much improved. Yes; but this is not so easy as it seems. Our dia­gnoses can very often only be made <em>ex post facto</em>. They are like the test for witch-find­ing applied by the Scot­tish king, of which I have read in one of Victor Hugo’s books. This king declared that he had an infal­lible method for detect­ing witches. He put them to simmer in a cauldron of boil­ing water, and then tasted the soup. Accord­ing to the taste he could say ‘that was a witch,’ or ‘that was not a witch’ The same thing hap­pens with us, except that it is we who are the suf­fer­ers. We cannot give an opin­ion about a patient who comes for treat­ment, or a can­did­ate for train­ing, until we have stud­ied him ana­lyt­ic­ally for some weeks or months. We are, in fact, always buying a pig in a poke. The sub­ject comes to us with undefined, gen­eral troubles which do not allow of any cer­tain dia­gnosis. After a period of pro­ba­tion it may turn out that the case is an unsuit­able one. Then, if he is a can­did­ate, we send him away; or, if he is a patient, we keep him on a little while to see whether we cannot take a more favour­able view of him. The patient has his revenge by swell­ing our list of fail­ures, and the rejec­ted can­did­ate, it may be (if he is para­noid), by writ­ing psycho-ana­lyt­ical books him­self. You will observe that our cau­tion has not been of much value to us.</p>
<p>I am afraid these details will have gone beyond the scope of your interests. But I should be even more dis­tressed if you were to think that I intend to dimin­ish your respect for psycho-ana­lysis as a thera­peutic pro­ced­ure. Per­haps I have really set about the busi­ness clum­sily. I wanted, you see, to achieve the oppos­ite: to excuse the thera­peutic lim­it­a­tions of ana­lysis by indic­at­ing how unavoid­able they are. With the same object in view, let me turn to another point, namely the com­plaint that ana­lytic treat­ment takes up a dis­pro­por­tion­ately long time. The answer to that is that psy­cho­lo­gical changes only come about very slowly; if they occur quickly and sud­denly it is a bad sign. It is true that the treat­ment of a ser­i­ous neur­osis may easily last sev­eral years, but if a suc­cess­ful result is achieved you must ask yourselves how long the ill­ness itself would oth­er­wise have lasted. It would prob­ably have lasted a decade for every year of treat­ment, which means that the ill­ness would never have passed off at all, as we so often find in untreated cases. In many instances we have reas­ons for resum­ing an ana­lysis after an inter­val of many years; new events in the patient’s life have called out in him new patho­lo­gical reac­tions, though in the mean­time he has been per­fectly healthy. The first ana­lysis had not actu­ally brought all his patho­lo­gical dis­pos­i­tions to the sur­face, and it was nat­ural that the ana­lysis should have been broken off as soon as it was suc­cess­ful. There are also people who are so ser­i­ously afflic­ted that they have to be kept under ana­lytic care through­out their whole lives and taken back into ana­lysis from time to time; but such people would oth­er­wise be incap­able of car­ry­ing on their lives at all, and one must be thank­ful that they can be kept going by means of this inter­mit­tent and recur­rent treat­ment. The ana­lysis of char­ac­ter­o­lo­gical dis­turb­ances, too, involves a lengthy treat­ment, but it is often suc­cess­ful; and it may be asked whether there is any other form of treat­ment that could even attempt to deal with this prob­lem. Thera­peutic ambi­tion may make us feel unsat­is­fied with these res­ults, but after all we have the examples of tuber­cu­losis and lupus before us, which teach us that one can only meet with suc­cess if the treat­ment is adap­ted to the char­ac­ter of the dis­ease.</p>
<p>I have told you that psycho-ana­lysis began as a thera­peutic pro­ced­ure, but it is not in that light that I wanted to recom­mend it to your interest, but because of the truths it con­tains, because of the inform­a­tion it gives us about that which is of the greatest import­ance to man­kind, namely his own nature, and because of the con­nec­tions it has shown to exist between the most vari­ous of his activ­it­ies. As a form of ther­apy it is one among many, though cer­tainly <em>prima inter pares</em>. If it had no thera­peutic value, it would not have been dis­covered from clin­ical mater­ial and would not have con­tin­ued to develop for more than thirty years.</p>

<h2>A Philo­sophy Of Life, Lec­ture XXXV</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ladies and gen­tle­men</span>—In the last lec­ture we were occu­pied with trivial every­day affairs, with put­ting, as it were, our modest house in order. We will now take a bold step, and risk an answer to a ques­tion which has repeatedly been raised in non-ana­lytic quar­ters, namely, the ques­tion whether psycho-ana­lysis leads to any par­tic­u­lar <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, and if so, to what.</p>
<p>‘<em>Weltan­schauung</em>’ is, I am afraid, a spe­cific­ally German notion, which it would be dif­fi­cult to trans­late into a for­eign lan­guage. If I attempt to give you a defin­i­tion of the word, it can hardly fail to strike you as inept. By <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, then, I mean an intel­lec­tual con­struc­tion, which gives a uni­fied solu­tion of all the prob­lems of our exist­ence in virtue of a com­pre­hens­ive hypo­thesis, a con­struc­tion, there­fore, in which no ques­tion is left open and in which everything in which we are inter­ested finds a place. It is easy to see that the pos­ses­sion of such a <em>Weltan­schauung</em> is one of the ideal wishes of man­kind. When one believes in such a thing, one feels secure in life, one knows what one ought to strive after, and how one ought to organ­ise one’s emo­tions and interests to the best pur­pose.</p>
<p>If that is what is meant by a <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, then the ques­tion is an easy one for psycho-ana­lysis to answer. As a spe­cial­ised sci­ence, a branch of psy­cho­logy—‘depth-psy­cho­logy’ or psy­cho­logy of the uncon­scious—it is quite unsuited to form a <em>Weltan­schauung</em> of its own; it must accept that of sci­ence in gen­eral. The sci­entific <em>Weltan­schauung</em> is, how­ever, markedly at vari­ance with our defin­i­tion. The <em>uni­fied</em> nature of the explan­a­tion of the uni­verse is, it is true, accep­ted by sci­ence, but only as a pro­gramme whose ful­fil­ment is post­poned to the future. Oth­er­wise it is dis­tin­guished by neg­at­ive char­ac­ter­ist­ics, by a lim­it­a­tion to what is, at any given time, know­able, and a cat­egor­ical rejec­tion of cer­tain ele­ments which are alien to it. It asserts that there is no other source of know­ledge of the uni­verse, but the intel­lec­tual manip­u­la­tion of care­fully veri­fied obser­va­tions, in fact, what is called research, and that no know­ledge can be obtained from rev­el­a­tion, intu­ition or inspir­a­tion. It appears that this way of look­ing at things came very near to receiv­ing gen­eral accept­ance during the last cen­tury or two. It has been reserved for the present cen­tury to raise the objec­tion that such a <em>Wel­tenschauung</em> is both empty and unsat­is­fy­ing, that it over­looks all the spir­itual demands of man, and all the needs of the human mind.</p>
<p>This objec­tion cannot be too strongly repu­di­ated. It cannot be sup­por­ted for a moment, for the spirit and the mind are the sub­ject of sci­entific invest­ig­a­tion in exactly the same way as any non-human entit­ies. Psycho-ana­lysis has a pecu­liar right to speak on behalf of the sci­entific <em>Weltan­schauung</em> in this con­nec­tion, because it cannot be accused of neg­lect­ing the part occu­pied by the mind in the uni­verse. The con­tri­bu­tion of psycho-ana­lysis to sci­ence con­sists pre­cisely in having exten­ded research to the region of the mind. Cer­tainly without such a psy­cho­logy, sci­ence would be very incom­plete. But if we add to sci­ence the invest­ig­a­tion of the intel­lec­tual and emo­tional func­tions of men (and anim­als), we find that noth­ing has been altered as regards the gen­eral pos­i­tion of sci­ence, that there are no new sources of know­ledge or meth­ods of research. Intu­ition and inspir­a­tion would be such, if they exis­ted; but they can safely be coun­ted as illu­sions, as ful­fil­ments of wishes. It is easy to see, moreover, that the qual­it­ies which, as we have shown, are expec­ted of a <em>Weltan­schauung</em> have a purely emo­tional basis. Sci­ence takes account of the fact that the mind of man cre­ates such demands and is ready to trace their source, but it has not the slight­est ground for think­ing them jus­ti­fied. On the con­trary, it does well to dis­tin­guish care­fully between illu­sion (the res­ults of emo­tional demands of that kind) and know­ledge.</p>
<p>This does not at all imply that we need push these wishes con­temp­tu­ously aside, or under­es­tim­ate their value in the lives of human beings. We are pre­pared to take notice of the ful­fil­ments they have achieved for them­selves in the cre­ations of art and in the sys­tems of reli­gion and philo­sophy; but we cannot over­look the fact, that it would be wrong and highly inex­pedi­ent to allow such things to be car­ried over into the domain of know­ledge. For in that way one would open the door which gives access to the region of the psychoses, whether indi­vidual or group psychoses, and one would drain off from these tend­en­cies valu­able energy which is dir­ec­ted towards real­ity and which seeks by means of real­ity to sat­isfy wishes and needs as far as this is pos­sible.</p>
<p>From the point of view of sci­ence we must neces­sar­ily make use of our crit­ical powers in this dir­ec­tion, and not be afraid to reject and deny. It is inad­miss­ible to declare that sci­ence is one field of human intel­lec­tual activ­ity, and that reli­gion and philo­sophy are others, at least as valu­able, and that sci­ence has no busi­ness to inter­fere with the other two, that they all have an equal claim to truth, and that every one is free to choose whence he shall draw his con­vic­tions and in what he shall place his belief. Such an atti­tude is con­sidered par­tic­u­larly respect­able, tol­er­ant, broad-minded, and free from narrow pre­ju­dices. Unfor­tu­nately it is not ten­able; it shares all the per­ni­cious qual­it­ies of an entirely unscientific <em>Weltan­schauung</em> and in prac­tice comes to much the same thing. The bare fact is that truth cannot be tol­er­ant and cannot admit com­prom­ise or lim­it­a­tions, that sci­entific research looks on the whole field of human activ­ity as its own, and must adopt an uncom­prom­isingly crit­ical atti­tude towards any other power that seeks to usurp any part of its province.</p>
<p>Of the three forces which can dis­pute the pos­i­tion of sci­ence, reli­gion alone is a really ser­i­ous enemy. Art is almost always harm­less and bene­fi­cent, it does not seek to be any­thing else but an illu­sion. Save in the case of a few people who are, one might say, obsessed by Art, it never dares to make any attacks on the realm of real­ity. Philo­sophy is not opposed to sci­ence, it behaves itself as if it were a sci­ence, and to a cer­tain extent it makes use of the same meth­ods; but it parts com­pany with sci­ence, in that it clings to the illu­sion that it can pro­duce a com­plete and coher­ent pic­ture of the uni­verse, though in fact that pic­ture must needs fall to pieces with every new advance in our know­ledge. Its meth­od­o­lo­gical error lies in the fact that it over-estim­ates the epi­stem­o­lo­gical value of our logical oper­a­tions, and to a cer­tain extent admits the valid­ity of other sources of know­ledge, such as intu­ition. And often enough one feels that the poet Heine is not unjus­ti­fied when he says of the philo­sopher:</p>
<blockquote>
With his night-cap and his night-shirt tat­ters,<br />
He botches up the loop-holes in the struc­ture of the world.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>But philo­sophy has no imme­di­ate influ­ence on the great major­ity of man­kind; it interests only a small number even of the thin upper stratum of intel­lec­tu­als, while all the rest find it beyond them. In con­tra­dis­tinc­tion to philo­sophy, reli­gion is a tre­mend­ous force, which exerts its power over the strongest emo­tions of human beings. As we know, at one time it included everything that played any part in the mental life of man­kind, that it took the place of sci­ence, when as yet sci­ence hardly exis­ted, and that it built up a <em>Weltan­schauung</em> of incom­par­able con­sist­ency and coher­ence, although it has been severely shaken, which has lasted to this day.</p>
<p>If one wishes to form a true estim­ate of the full grandeur of reli­gion, one must keep in mind what it under­takes to do for men. It gives them inform­a­tion about the source and origin of the uni­verse, it assures them of pro­tec­tion and final hap­pi­ness amid the chan­ging vicis­situdes of life, and it guides their thoughts and actions by means of pre­cepts which are backed by the whole force of its author­ity. It ful­fils, there­fore, three func­tions. In the first place, it sat­is­fies man’s desire for know­ledge; it is here doing the same thing that sci­ence attempts to accom­plish by its own meth­ods, and here, there­fore, enters into rivalry with it. It is to the second func­tion that it per­forms, that reli­gion no doubt owes the greater part of its influ­ence. In so far as reli­gion brushes away men’s fear of the dangers and vicis­situdes of life, in so far as it assures them of a happy ending, and com­forts them in their mis­for­tunes, sci­ence cannot com­pete with it. Sci­ence, it is true, teaches how one can avoid cer­tain dangers and how one can combat many suf­fer­ings with suc­cess; it would be quite untrue to deny that sci­ence is a power­ful aid to human beings, but in many cases it has to leave them to their suf­fer­ing, and can only advise them to submit to the inev­it­able. In the per­form­ance of its third func­tion, the pro­vi­sion of pre­cepts, pro­hib­i­tions, and restric­tions, reli­gion is fur­thest removed from sci­ence. For sci­ence is con­tent with dis­cov­er­ing and stat­ing the facts. It is true that from the applic­a­tions of sci­ence, rules and recom­mend­a­tions for beha­viour may be deduced. In cer­tain cir­cum­stances they may be the same as those which are laid down by reli­gion, but even so the reas­ons for them will be dif­fer­ent.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear why reli­gion should com­bine these three func­tions. What has the explan­a­tion of the origin of the uni­verse to do with the incul­ca­tion of cer­tain eth­ical pre­cepts? Its assur­ances of pro­tec­tion and hap­pi­ness are more closely con­nec­ted with these pre­cepts. They are the reward for the ful­fil­ment of the com­mands; only he who obeys them can count on receiv­ing these bene­fits, while pun­ish­ment awaits the dis­obedi­ent. For the matter of that some­thing of the same kind applies to sci­ence; for it declares that any one who dis­reg­ards its infer­ences is liable to suffer for it.</p>
<p>One can only under­stand this remark­able com­bin­a­tion of teach­ing, con­sol­a­tion and pre­cept in reli­gion, if one sub­jects it to genetic ana­lysis. We may begin with the most remark­able item of the three, the teach­ing about the origin of the uni­verse—for why should a cos­mogony be a reg­u­lar ele­ment of reli­gious sys­tems? The doc­trine is that the uni­verse was cre­ated by a being sim­ilar to man, but greater in every respect, in power, wisdom, and strength of pas­sion, in fact by an ideal­ized super­man. Where you have anim­als as cre­at­ors of the uni­verse, you have indic­a­tions of the influ­ence of Totem­ism, which I shall touch on later, at any rate with a brief remark. It is inter­est­ing to notice that this cre­ator of the uni­verse is always a single god, even when many gods are believed in. Equally inter­est­ing is the fact that the cre­ator is nearly always a male, although there is no lack of indic­a­tion of the exist­ence of female deit­ies and many myth­o­lo­gies make the cre­ation of the world begin pre­cisely with a male god tri­umph­ing over a female god­dess, who is degraded into a mon­ster. This raises the most fas­cin­at­ing minor prob­lems, but we must hurry on. The rest of our enquiry is made easy because this God-Cre­ator is openly called Father. Psycho-ana­lysis con­cludes that he really is the father, clothed in the grandeur in which he once appeared to the small child. The reli­gious man’s pic­ture of the cre­ation of the uni­verse is the same as his pic­ture of his own cre­ation.</p>
<p>If this is so, then it is easy to under­stand how it is that the com­fort­ing prom­ises of pro­tec­tion and the severe eth­ical com­mands are found together with the cos­mogony. For the same indi­vidual, to whom the child owes its own exist­ence, the father (or, more cor­rectly, the par­ental func­tion which is com­posed of the father and the mother), has pro­tec­ted and watched over the weak and help­less child, exposed as it is to all the dangers which threaten in the external world; in its father’s care it has felt itself safe. Even the grown man, though he may know that he pos­sesses greater strength, and though he has greater insight into the dangers of life, rightly feels that fun­da­ment­ally he is just as help­less and unpro­tec­ted as he was in child­hood and that in rela­tion to the external world he is still a child. Even now, there­fore, he cannot give up the pro­tec­tion which he has enjoyed as a child. But he has long ago real­ised that his father is a being with strictly lim­ited powers and by no means endowed with every desir­able attrib­ute. He there­fore looks back to the memory-image of the over­rated father of his child­hood, exalts it into a Deity, and brings it into the present and into real­ity. The emo­tional strength of this memory-image and the last­ing nature of his need for pro­tec­tion are the two sup­ports of his belief in God.</p>
<p>The third main point of the reli­gious pro­gramme, its eth­ical pre­cepts, can also be related without any dif­fi­culty to the situ­ation of child­hood. In a famous pas­sage, which I have already quoted in an earlier lec­ture, the philo­sopher Kant speaks of the starry heaven above us and the moral law within us as the strongest evid­ence for the great­ness of God. How­ever odd it may sound to put these two side by side—for what can the heav­enly bodies have to do with the ques­tion whether one man loves another or kills him? nev­er­the­less it touches on a great psy­cho­lo­gical truth. The same father (the par­ental func­tion) who gave the child his life and pre­served it from the dangers which that life involves, also taught it what it may or may not do, made it accept cer­tain lim­it­a­tions of its instinctual wishes, and told it what con­sid­er­a­tion it would be expec­ted to show towards its par­ents and broth­ers and sis­ters, if it wanted to be tol­er­ated and liked as a member of the family circle, and later on of more extens­ive groups. The child is brought up to know its social duties by means of a system of love-rewards and pun­ish­ments, and in this way it is taught that its secur­ity in life depends on its par­ents (and, sub­sequently, other people) loving it and being able to believe in its love for them. This whole state of affairs is car­ried over by the grown man unaltered into his reli­gion. The pro­hib­i­tions and com­mands of his par­ents live on in his breast as his moral con­science; God rules the world of men with the help of the same system of rewards and pun­ish­ments, and the degree of pro­tec­tion and hap­pi­ness which each indi­vidual enjoys, depends on his ful­fil­ment of the demands of mor­al­ity; the feel­ing of secur­ity, with which he for­ti­fies him­self against the dangers both of the external world and of his human envir­on­ment, is foun­ded on his love of God and the con­scious­ness of God’s love for him. Finally, he has in prayer a direct influ­ence on the divine will, and in that way insures for him­self a share in the divine omni­po­tence.</p>
<p>I am sure that while you have been listen­ing to me, a whole host of ques­tions must have come into your minds which you would like to have answered. I cannot under­take to do so here and now, but I am per­fectly cer­tain that none of these ques­tions of detail would shake our thesis that the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> is determ­ined by the situ­ation that sub­sisted in our child­hood. It is there­fore all the more remark­able that, in spite of its infant­ile char­ac­ter, it nev­er­the­less has a fore­run­ner. There was, without doubt, a time when there were no reli­gions and no gods. It is known as the age of anim­ism. Even at that time the world was full of spir­its in the semb­lance of men (demons, as we call them), and all the objects in the external world were their dwell­ing-place or per­haps identical with them, but there was no supreme power which had cre­ated them all, which con­trolled them, and to which it was pos­sible to turn for pro­tec­tion and aid. The demons of anim­ism were usu­ally hos­tile to man, but it seems as though man had more con­fid­ence in him­self in those days than later on. He was no doubt in con­stant terror of these evil spir­its, but he defen­ded him­self against them by means of cer­tain actions to which he ascribed the power to drive them away. Nor did he think him­self entirely power­less in other ways. If he wanted some­thing from nature—rain, for instance—he did not direct a prayer to the Weather-god, but used a spell, by means of which he expec­ted to exert a direct influ­ence over nature; he him­self made some­thing which resembled rain. In his fight against the powers of the sur­round­ing world his first weapon was magic, the first fore­run­ner of our modern tech­no­logy. We sup­pose that this con­fid­ence in magic is derived from the over­es­tim­a­tion of the indi­vidual’s own intel­lec­tual oper­a­tions, from the belief in the ‘omni­po­tence of thoughts,’ which, incid­ent­ally, we come across again in our obses­sional neur­ot­ics. We may ima­gine that the men of that time were par­tic­u­larly proud of their acquis­i­tion of speech, which must have been accom­pan­ied by a great facil­it­a­tion of thought. They attrib­uted magic power to the spoken word. This fea­ture was later on taken over by reli­gion. ‘And God said: Let there be light, and there was light’ But the fact of magic actions shows that anim­istic man did not rely entirely on the force of his own wishes. On the con­trary, he depended for suc­cess upon the per­form­ance of an action, which would cause Nature to imit­ate it. If he wanted it to rain, he him­self poured out water; if he wanted to stim­u­late the soil to fer­til­ity, he offered it a per­form­ance of sexual inter­course in the fields.</p>
<p>You know how ten­a­ciously any­thing that has once found psy­cho­lo­gical expres­sion per­sists. You will there­fore not be sur­prised to hear that a great many mani­fest­a­tions of anim­ism have lasted up to the present day, mostly as what are called super­sti­tions; side by side with and behind reli­gion. But more than that, you can hardly avoid coming to the con­clu­sion that our philo­sophy has pre­served essen­tial traits of anim­istic modes of thought such as the over­es­tim­a­tion of the magic of words and the belief that real pro­cesses in the external world follow the lines laid down by our thoughts. It is, to be sure, an anim­ism without magical prac­tices. On the other hand we should expect to find that in the age of anim­ism there must already have been some kind of mor­al­ity, some rules gov­ern­ing the inter­course of men with one another. But there is no evid­ence that they were closely bound up with anim­istic beliefs. Prob­ably they were the imme­di­ate expres­sion of the dis­tri­bu­tion of power and of prac­tical neces­sit­ies.</p>
<p>It would be very inter­est­ing to know what determ­ined the trans­ition from anim­ism to reli­gion; but you may ima­gine in what dark­ness this earli­est epoch in the evol­u­tion of the human mind is still shrouded. It seems to be a fact that the earli­est form in which reli­gion appeared was the remark­able one of totem­ism, the wor­ship of anim­als, in the train of which fol­lowed the first eth­ical com­mands, the taboos. In a book called <em>Totem und Tabu</em>, I once worked out a sug­ges­tion, in accord­ance with which this change is to be traced back to an upheaval in the rela­tion­ships in the human family. The main achieve­ment of reli­gion, as com­pared with anim­ism, lies in the psychic bind­ing of the fear of demons. Nev­er­the­less, the evil spirit still has a place in the reli­gious system as a relic of the pre­vi­ous age.</p>
<p>So much for the pre-his­tory of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. Let us now turn to con­sider what has happened since, and what is still going on under our own eyes. The sci­entific spirit, strengthened by the obser­va­tion of nat­ural pro­cesses, began in the course of time to treat reli­gion as a human matter, and to sub­ject it to a crit­ical exam­in­a­tion. This test it failed to pass. In the first place, the accounts of mir­acles roused a feel­ing of sur­prise and dis­be­lief, since they con­tra­dicted everything that sober obser­va­tion had taught, and betrayed all too clearly the influ­ence of human ima­gin­a­tion. In the next place, its account of the nature of the uni­verse had to be rejec­ted, because it showed evid­ence of a lack of know­ledge which bore the stamp of earlier days, and because, owing to increas­ing famili­ar­ity with the laws of nature, it had lost its author­ity. The idea that the uni­verse came into being through an act of gen­er­a­tion or cre­ation, ana­log­ous to that which pro­duces an indi­vidual human being, no longer seemed to be the most obvi­ous and self-evid­ent hypo­thesis; for the dis­tinc­tion between living and sen­tient beings and inan­im­ate nature had become appar­ent to the human mind, and had made it impossible to retain the ori­ginal anim­istic theory. Besides this, one must not over­look the influ­ence of the com­par­at­ive study of dif­fer­ent reli­gious sys­tems, and the impres­sion they give of mutual exclus­ive­ness and intol­er­ance.</p>
<p>For­ti­fied by these pre­lim­in­ary efforts, the sci­entific spirit at last summoned up cour­age to put to the test the most import­ant and the most emo­tion­ally sig­ni­fic­ant ele­ments of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. The truth could have been seen at any time, but it was long before any one dared to say it aloud: the asser­tions made by reli­gion that it could give pro­tec­tion and hap­pi­ness to men, if they would only fulfil cer­tain eth­ical oblig­a­tions, were unworthy of belief. It seems not to be true that there is a power in the uni­verse, which watches over the well-being of every indi­vidual with par­ental care and brings all his con­cerns to a happy ending. On the con­trary the des­tinies of man are incom­pat­ible with a uni­ver­sal prin­ciple of bene­vol­ence or with—what is to some degree con­tra­dict­ory—a uni­ver­sal prin­ciple of justice. Earth­quakes, floods and fires do not dif­fer­en­ti­ate between the good and devout man, and the sinner and unbe­liever. And, even if we leave inan­im­ate nature out of account and con­sider the des­tinies of indi­vidual men in so far as they depend on their rela­tions with others of their own kind, it is by no means the rule that virtue is rewar­ded and wicked­ness pun­ished, but it hap­pens often enough that the viol­ent, the crafty and the unprin­cipled seize the desir­able goods of the earth for them­selves, while the pious go empty away. Dark, unfeel­ing and unlov­ing powers determ­ine human des­tiny; the system of rewards and pun­ish­ments, which, accord­ing to reli­gion, gov­erns the world, seems to have no exist­ence. This is another occa­sion for abandon­ing a por­tion of the anim­ism which has found refuge in reli­gion.</p>
<p>The last con­tri­bu­tion to the cri­ti­cism of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> has been made by psycho-ana­lysis, which has traced the origin of reli­gion to the help­less­ness of child­hood, and its con­tent to the per­sist­ence of the wishes and needs of child­hood into matur­ity. This does not pre­cisely imply a refut­a­tion of reli­gion, but it is a neces­sary round­ing off of our know­ledge about it, and, at least on one point, it actu­ally con­tra­dicts it, for reli­gion lays claim to a divine origin. This claim, to be sure, is not false if our inter­pret­a­tion of God is accep­ted.</p>
<p>The final judg­ment of sci­ence on the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, then, runs as fol­lows. While the dif­fer­ent reli­gions wrangle with one another as to which of them is in pos­ses­sion of the truth, in our view the truth of reli­gion may be alto­gether dis­reg­arded. Reli­gion is an attempt to get con­trol over the sens­ory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which we have developed inside us as a result of bio­lo­gical and psy­cho­lo­gical neces­sit­ies. But it cannot achieve its end. Its doc­trines carry with them the stamp of the times in which they ori­gin­ated, the ignor­ant child­hood days of the human race. Its con­sol­a­tions deserve no trust. Exper­i­ence teaches us that the world is not a nurs­ery. The eth­ical com­mands, to which reli­gion seeks to lend its weight, require some other found­a­tions instead, for human soci­ety cannot do without them, and it is dan­ger­ous to link up obed­i­ence to them with reli­gious belief. If one attempts to assign to reli­gion its place in man’s evol­u­tion, it seems not so much to be a last­ing acquis­i­tion, as a par­al­lel to the neur­osis which the civ­il­ised indi­vidual must pass through on his way from child­hood to matur­ity.</p>
<p>You are, of course, per­fectly free to cri­ti­cise this account of mine, and I am pre­pared to meet you half way. What I have said about the gradual crum­bling of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> was no doubt an incom­plete abridg­ment of the whole story; the order of the sep­ar­ate events was not quite cor­rectly given, and the cooper­a­tion of vari­ous forces towards the awaken­ing of the sci­entific spirit was not traced. I have also left out of account the alter­a­tions which occurred in the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> itself, both during the period of its unchal­lenged author­ity and after­wards under the influ­ence of awaken­ing cri­ti­cism. Finally I have, strictly speak­ing, lim­ited my remarks to one single form of reli­gion, that of the West­ern peoples. I have, as it were, con­struc­ted a lay-figure for the pur­poses of a demon­stra­tion which I desired to be as rapid and as impress­ive as pos­sible. Let us leave on one side the ques­tion of whether my know­ledge would in any case have been suf­fi­cient to enable me to do it better or more com­pletely. I am aware that you can find all that I have said else­where, and find it better said; none of it is new. But I am firmly con­vinced that the most care­ful elab­or­a­tion of the mater­ial upon which the prob­lems of reli­gion are based would not shake these con­clu­sions.</p>
<p>As you know, the struggle between the sci­entific spirit and the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> is not yet at an end; it is still going on under our very eyes to-day. How­ever little psycho-ana­lysis may make use as a rule of polem­ical weapons, we will not deny ourselves the pleas­ure of look­ing into this con­flict. Incid­ent­ally, we may per­haps arrive at a clearer under­stand­ing of our atti­tude towards the <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. You will see how easily some of the argu­ments which are brought for­ward by the sup­port­ers of reli­gion can be dis­proved; though others may suc­ceed in escap­ing refut­a­tion.</p>
<p>The first objec­tion that one hears is to the effect that it is an imper­tin­ence on the part of sci­ence to take reli­gion as a sub­ject for its invest­ig­a­tions, since reli­gion is some­thing supreme, some­thing super­ior to the capa­cit­ies of the human under­stand­ing, some­thing which must not be approached with the soph­is­tries of cri­ti­cism. In other words, sci­ence is not com­pet­ent to sit in judg­ment on reli­gion. No doubt it is quite useful and valu­able, so long as it is restric­ted to its own province; but reli­gion does not lie in that province, and with reli­gion it can have noth­ing to do. If we are not deterred by this brusque dis­missal, but enquire on what grounds reli­gion bases its claim to an excep­tional pos­i­tion among human con­cerns, the answer we receive, if indeed we are hon­oured with an answer at all, is that reli­gion cannot be meas­ured by human stand­ards, since it is of divine origin, and has been revealed to us by a spirit which the human mind cannot grasp. It might surely be thought that noth­ing could be more easily refuted than this argu­ment; it is an obvi­ous <em>peti­tio prin­cipii</em>, a ‘beg­ging of the ques­tion.’ The point which is being called in ques­tion is whether there is a divine spirit and a rev­el­a­tion; and it surely cannot be a con­clus­ive reply to say that the ques­tion cannot be asked, because the Deity cannot be called in ques­tion. What is hap­pen­ing here is the same kind of thing as we meet with occa­sion­ally in our ana­lytic work. If an oth­er­wise intel­li­gent patient denies a sug­ges­tion on par­tic­u­larly stupid grounds, his imper­fect logic is evid­ence for the exist­ence of a par­tic­u­larly strong motive for his making the denial, a motive which can only be of an affect­ive nature and serve to bind an emo­tion.</p>
<p>Another sort of answer may be given, in which a motive of this kind is openly admit­ted. Reli­gion must not be crit­ic­ally examined, because it is the highest, most pre­cious and noblest thing that the mind of man has brought forth, because it gives expres­sion to the deep­est feel­ings, and is the only thing that makes the world bear­able and life worthy of human­ity. To this we need not reply by dis­put­ing this estim­ate of reli­gion, but rather by draw­ing atten­tion to another aspect of the matter. We should point out that it is not a ques­tion of the sci­entific spirit encroach­ing upon the sphere of reli­gion, but of reli­gion encroach­ing upon the sphere of sci­entific thought. Whatever value and import­ance reli­gion may have, it has no right to set any limits to thought, and there­fore has no right to except itself from the applic­a­tion of thought.</p>
<p>Sci­entific thought is, in its essence, no dif­fer­ent from the normal pro­cess of think­ing, which we all, believ­ers and unbe­liev­ers, alike, make use of when we are going about our busi­ness in every­day life. It has merely taken a spe­cial form in cer­tain respects: it extends its interest to things which have no imme­di­ate obvi­ous util­ity, it endeav­ours to elim­in­ate per­sonal factors and emo­tional influ­ences, it care­fully exam­ines the trust­wor­thi­ness of the sense per­cep­tions on which it bases its con­clu­sions, it provides itself with new per­cep­tions which are not obtain­able by every­day means, and isol­ates the determ­in­ants of these new exper­i­ences by pur­posely varied exper­i­ment­a­tion. Its aim is to arrive at cor­res­pond­ence with real­ity, that is to say with what exists out­side us and inde­pend­ently of us, and, as exper­i­ence has taught us, is decis­ive for the ful­fil­ment or frus­tra­tion of our desires. This cor­res­pond­ence with the real external world we call truth. It is the aim of sci­entific work, even when the prac­tical value of that work does not interest us. When, there­fore, reli­gion claims that it can take the place of sci­ence and that, because it is bene­fi­cent and ennobling, it must there­fore be true, that claim is, in fact, an encroach­ment, which, in the interests of every one, should be res­isted. It is asking a great deal of a man, who has learnt to reg­u­late his every­day affairs in accord­ance with the rules of exper­i­ence and with due regard to real­ity, that he should entrust pre­cisely what affects him most nearly to the care of an author­ity which claims as its prerog­at­ive free­dom from all the rules of rational thought. And, as for the pro­tec­tion that reli­gion prom­ises its believ­ers, I hardly think that any of us would be will­ing even to enter a motor-car, if the driver informed us that he drove without allow­ing him­self to be dis­trac­ted by traffic reg­u­la­tions, but in accord­ance with the impulses of an exal­ted ima­gin­a­tion.</p>
<p>And indeed the ban which reli­gion has imposed upon thought in the interests of its own pre­ser­va­tion is by no means without danger both for the indi­vidual and for soci­ety. Ana­lytic exper­i­ence has taught us that such pro­hib­i­tions, even though they were ori­gin­ally con­fined to some par­tic­u­lar field, have a tend­ency to spread, and then become the cause of severe inhib­i­tions in people’s lives. In women a pro­cess of this sort can be observed to follow from the pro­hib­i­tion against their occupy­ing them­selves, even in thought, with the sexual side of their nature. The bio­graph­ies of almost all the emin­ent people of past times show the dis­astrous res­ults of the inhib­i­tion of thought by reli­gion. Intel­lect, on the other hand,—or rather, to call it by a more famil­iar name, reason—is among the forces which may be expec­ted to exert a uni­fy­ing influ­ence upon men—creatures who can be held together only with the greatest dif­fi­culty, and whom it is there­fore scarcely pos­sible to con­trol. Think how impossible human soci­ety would be if every one had his own par­tic­u­lar mul­ti­plic­a­tion table and his own private units of weight and length. Our best hope for the future is that the intel­lect—the sci­entific spirit, reason—should in time estab­lish a dic­tat­or­ship over the human mind. The very nature of reason is a guar­an­tee that it would not fail to con­cede to human emo­tions and to all that is determ­ined by them, the pos­i­tion to which they are entitled. But the common pres­sure exer­cised by such a dom­in­a­tion of reason would prove to be the strongest uni­fy­ing force among men, and would pre­pare the way for fur­ther uni­fic­a­tions. Whatever, like the ban laid upon thought by reli­gion, opposes such a devel­op­ment is a danger for the future of man­kind.</p>
<p>The ques­tion may now be asked why reli­gion does not put an end to this losing fight by openly declar­ing: ‘It is a fact that I cannot give you what men com­monly call truth; to obtain that, you must go to sci­ence. But what I have to give you is incom­par­ably more beau­ti­ful, more com­fort­ing and more ennobling than any­thing that you could ever get from sci­ence. And I there­fore say to you that it is true in a dif­fer­ent and higher sense.’ The answer is easy to find. Reli­gion cannot make this admis­sion, because if it did it would lose all influ­ence over the mass of man­kind. The ordin­ary man knows only one ‘truth’—truth in the ordin­ary sense of the word. What may be meant by a higher, or a highest, truth, he cannot ima­gine. Truth seems to him as little cap­able of having degrees as death, and the neces­sary leap from the beau­ti­ful to the true is one that he cannot make. Per­haps you will agree with me in think­ing that he is right in this.</p>
<p>The struggle, there­fore, is not yet at an end. The fol­low­ers of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em> act in accord­ance with the old maxim: the best defence is attack. ‘What,’ they ask, ‘is this sci­ence that pre­sumes to depre­ci­ate our reli­gion, which has brought sal­va­tion and com­fort to mil­lions of men for many thou­sands of years? What has sci­ence for its part so far accom­plished? What more can be expec­ted of it? On its own admis­sion, it is incap­able of com­fort­ing or ennobling us. We will leave that on one side, there­fore, though it is by no means easy to give up such bene­fits. But what of its teach­ing? Can it tell us how the world began, and what fate is in store for it? Can it even paint for us a coher­ent pic­ture of the uni­verse, and show us where the unex­plained phe­nom­ena of life fit in, and how spir­itual forces are able to oper­ate on inert matter? If it could do that we should not refuse it our respect. But it has done noth­ing of the sort, not one single prob­lem of this kind has it solved. It gives us frag­ments of alleged know­ledge, which it cannot har­mon­ize with one another, it col­lects obser­va­tions of uni­form­it­ies from the total­ity of events, and dig­ni­fies them with the name of laws and sub­jects them to its haz­ard­ous inter­pret­a­tions. And with what a small degree of cer­ti­tude does it estab­lish its con­clu­sions! All that it teaches is only pro­vi­sion­ally true; what is prized to-day as the highest wisdom is over­thrown to-morrow and exper­i­ment­ally replaced by some­thing else. The latest error is then given the name of truth. And to this truth we are asked to sac­ri­fice our highest good!’</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—in so far as you yourselves are sup­port­ers of the sci­entific <em>Weltan­schauung</em> I do not think you will be very pro­foundly shaken by this critic’s attack. In Imper­ial Aus­tria an anec­dote was once cur­rent which I should like to call to mind in this con­nec­tion. On one occa­sion the old Emperor was receiv­ing a depu­ta­tion from a polit­ical party which he dis­liked: ‘This is no longer ordin­ary oppos­i­tion,’ he burst out, ‘this is fac­tious oppos­i­tion.’ In just the same way you will find that the reproaches made against sci­ence for not having solved the riddle of the uni­verse are unfairly and spite­fully exag­ger­ated. Sci­ence has had too little time for such a tre­mend­ous achieve­ment. It is still very young, a recently developed human activ­ity. Let us bear in mind, to men­tion only a few dates, that only about three hun­dred years have passed since Kepler dis­covered the laws of plan­et­ary move­ment; the life of Newton, who split up light into the col­ours of the spec­trum, and put for­ward the theory of grav­it­a­tion, came to end in 1727, that is to say a little more than two hun­dred years ago; and Lavois­ier dis­covered oxygen shortly before the French Revolu­tion. I may be a very old man to-day, but the life of an indi­vidual man is very short in com­par­ison with the dur­a­tion of human devel­op­ment, and it is a fact that I was alive when Charles Darwin pub­lished his work on the origin of spe­cies. In the same year, 1859, Pierre Curie, the dis­coverer of radium, was born. And if you go back to the begin­nings of exact nat­ural sci­ence among the Greeks, to Archimedes, or to Aristarchus of Samos (<em>circ</em>. 250 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>) the fore­run­ner of Coper­ni­cus, or even to the tent­at­ive ori­gins of astro­nomy among the Baby­lo­ni­ans, you will only be cov­er­ing a very small por­tion of the period which anthro­po­logy requires for the evol­u­tion of man from his ori­ginal ape­like form, a period which cer­tainly embraces more than a hun­dred thou­sand years. And it must not be for­got­ten that the last cen­tury has brought with it such a quant­ity of new dis­cov­er­ies and such a great accel­er­a­tion of sci­entific pro­gress that we have every reason to look for­ward with con­fid­ence to the future of sci­ence.</p>
<p>It has to be admit­ted that the other objec­tions are valid within cer­tain limits. Thus it is true that the path of sci­ence is slow, tent­at­ive and labor­i­ous. That cannot be denied or altered. No wonder that the gen­tle­men of the oppos­i­tion are dis­sat­is­fied; they are spoilt, they have had an easier time of it with their rev­el­a­tion. Pro­gress in sci­entific work is made in just the same way as in ana­lysis. The ana­lyst brings expect­a­tions with him to his work, but he must keep them in the back­ground. He dis­cov­ers some­thing new by obser­va­tion, now here and now there, and at first the bits do not fit together. He puts for­ward sup­pos­i­tions, he brings con­struc­tions to one’s aid, and gives them up if they are not con­firmed, he must have a great deal of patience, must be pre­pared for all pos­sib­il­it­ies, and must not jump at con­clu­sions for fear of their lead­ing him to over­look new and unex­pec­ted factors. And in the end the whole expendit­ure of effort is rewar­ded, the scattered dis­cov­er­ies fall into place and he obtains an under­stand­ing of a whole chain of mental events; he has fin­ished one piece of work and is ready for the next. But the ana­lyst is unlike other sci­entific work­ers in this one respect that he has to do without the help which exper­i­ment can bring to research.</p>
<p>But the cri­ti­cism of sci­ence which I have quoted also con­tains a great deal of exag­ger­a­tion. It is not true to say that it swings blindly from one attempt to another, and exchanges one error for the next. As a rule the man of sci­ence works like a sculptor with a clay model, who per­sist­ently alters the first rough sketch, adds to it and takes away from it, until he has obtained a sat­is­fact­ory degree of sim­il­ar­ity to some object, whether seen or ima­gined. And, moreover, at least in the older and more mature sci­ences, there is already a solid found­a­tion of know­ledge, which is now only mod­i­fied and elab­or­ated and no longer demol­ished. The out­look, in fact, is not so bad in the world of sci­ence.</p>
<p>And finally, what is the pur­pose of all these pas­sion­ate dis­par­age­ments of sci­ence? In spite of its present incom­plete­ness and its inher­ent dif­fi­culties, we could not do without it and could not put any­thing else in its place. There is no limit to the improve­ment of which it is cap­able, and this can cer­tainly not be said of the reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. The latter is com­plete in its essen­tials; if it is an error, it must remain one for ever. No attempt to min­im­ise the import­ance of sci­ence can alter the fact that it attempts to take into account our depend­ence on the real external world, while reli­gion is illu­sion, and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.</p>
<p>I must now go on to men­tion some other types of <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, which are in oppos­i­tion to the sci­entific one; I do so, how­ever, unwill­ingly, because I know that I am not com­pet­ent to form a judg­ment upon them. I hope, there­fore, that you will bear this con­fes­sion in mind in listen­ing to what I have to say, and that if your interest is aroused you will go else­where for more trust­worthy inform­a­tion.</p>
<p>In the first place I ought at this point to name the vari­ous philo­soph­ical sys­tems which have ven­tured to draw a pic­ture of the world, as it is reflec­ted in the minds of thinkers whose eyes are as a rule turned away from it. But I have already attemp­ted to give a gen­eral char­ac­ter­isa­tion of philo­sophy and its meth­ods, and I believe I am more unfit­ted than almost any one to pass the indi­vidual sys­tems under review. I shall ask you, there­fore, instead to turn your atten­tion to two other phe­nom­ena which, par­tic­u­larly in these days, cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The <em>Weltan­schauung</em> to which I shall first refer is, as it were, a coun­ter­part of polit­ical anarch­ism, and may per­haps have eman­ated from it. No doubt there have been intel­lec­tual nihil­ists of this kind before, but at the present day the theory of relativ­ity of modern phys­ics seems to have gone to their heads. It is true that they start out from sci­ence, but they suc­ceed in for­cing it to cut the ground from under its own feet, to commit sui­cide, as it were; they make it dis­pose of itself by get­ting it to refute its own premises. One often has an impres­sion that this nihil­ism is only a tem­por­ary atti­tude, which will only be kept up until this task has been com­pleted. When once sci­ence has been got rid of, some kind of mys­ti­cism, or, indeed, the old reli­gious <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, can spring up in the space that has been left vacant. Accord­ing to this anarch­istic doc­trine, there is no such thing as truth, no assured know­ledge of the external world. What we give out as sci­entific truth is only the product of our own needs and desires, as they are for­mu­lated under vary­ing external con­di­tions; that is to say, it is illu­sion once more. Ulti­mately we find only what we need to find, and see only what we desire to see. We can do noth­ing else. And since the cri­terion of truth, cor­res­pond­ence with an external world, dis­ap­pears, it is abso­lutely imma­ter­ial what views we accept. All of them are equally true and false. And no one has a right to accuse any one else of error.</p>
<p>For a mind which is inter­ested in epi­stem­o­logy, it would be tempt­ing to enquire into the con­triv­ances and soph­is­tries by means of which the anarch­ists manage to elicit a final product of this kind from sci­ence. One would no doubt be brought up against situ­ations like the one involved in the famil­iar example of the Cretan who says that all Cretans are liars. But I am not desirous, nor am I cap­able, of going deeper into this. I will merely remark that the anarch­istic theory only retains its remark­able air of superi­or­ity so long as it is con­cerned with opin­ions about abstract things; it breaks down the moment it comes in con­tact with prac­tical life. Now the beha­viour of men is guided by their opin­ions and know­ledge, and the same sci­entific spirit which spec­u­lates about the struc­ture of the atom or the origin of man is con­cerned in the build­ing of a bridge that will bear its load. If it were really a matter of indif­fer­ence what we believed, if there were no know­ledge which was dis­tin­guished from among our opin­ions by the fact that it cor­res­ponds with real­ity, then we might just as well build our bridges of card­board as of stone, or inject a tenth of a gramme of morphia into a patient instead of a hun­dredth, or take tear-gas as a nar­cotic instead of ether. But the intel­lec­tual anarch­ists them­selves would strongly repu­di­ate such prac­tical applic­a­tions of their theory.</p>
<p>The other oppos­ing <em>Weltan­schauung</em> is to be taken far more ser­i­ously, and in this case I very deeply regret the insuf­fi­ciency of my know­ledge. I dare say that you know more about this sub­ject than I do and that you have long ago taken up your pos­i­tion for or against Marx­ism. The invest­ig­a­tions of Karl Marx into the eco­nomic struc­ture of soci­ety and into the influ­ence of vari­ous forms of eco­nomic organ­isa­tion upon all depart­ments of human life have in our day acquired an author­ity that cannot be denied. How far they are right or wrong in detail, I nat­ur­ally do not know. I gather that it is not easy even for better informed people to decide. Some of the pro­pos­i­tions in Marx’s theory seem strange to me, such as that the evol­u­tion of forms of soci­ety is a pro­cess of nat­ural his­tory, or that the changes in social strat­i­fic­a­tion pro­ceed from one another in the manner of a dia­lect­ical pro­cess: I am by no means cer­tain that I under­stand these state­ments rightly; moreover, they do not sound ‘mater­i­al­istic’ but like traces of the obscure Hegel­ian philo­sophy under the influ­ence of which Marx at one time passed. I do not know how I can throw off the view which I share with other laymen, who are inclined to trace back the form­a­tion of classes in soci­ety to the struggles which went on from the begin­ning of his­tory between vari­ous human hordes. These hordes differed to a slight degree from one another; and it is my view that social dif­fer­ences go back to these ori­ginal dif­fer­ences of tribe or race. Psy­cho­lo­gical factors, such as the amount of con­sti­tu­tional aggress­ive­ness and also the degree of cohe­sion within the horde, and mater­ial factors, such as the pos­ses­sion of better weapons, decided the vic­tory. When they came to live together in the same ter­rit­ory, the vic­tors became the mas­ters and conquered the slaves. There is no sign in all this of nat­ural laws or con­cep­tual modi­fic­a­tions; on the other hand, we cannot fail to recog­nise the influ­ence which the pro­gress­ive con­trol over nat­ural forces exerts on the social rela­tion­ships between men, since men always place their newly won powers at the ser­vice of their aggress­ive­ness, and use them against one another. The intro­duc­tion of metals, of bronze and iron, put an end to whole cul­tural epochs and their social insti­tu­tions. I really believe that gun­powder and fire-arms over­threw chiv­alry and the dom­in­a­tion of the aris­to­cracy, and that the Rus­sian des­pot­ism was already doomed before the war was lost, since no amount of in-breed­ing among the ruling fam­il­ies of Europe could have pro­duced a race of Tsars cap­able of with­stand­ing the explos­ive force of dynam­ite.</p>
<p>It may be, indeed, that with the present eco­nomic crisis which fol­lowed upon the Great War, we are merely paying the price of our latest tri­umph over nature, the con­quest of the air. This does not sound very con­vin­cing, but at least the first links in the chain of argu­ment are clearly recog­nis­able. The policy of Eng­land was based on the secur­ity guar­an­teed by the seas which encircle her coasts. The moment Blériot flew over the Chan­nel in his aero­plane, this pro­tect­ive isol­a­tion was broken through; and on the night on which, in a time of peace, a German Zep­pelin made an exper­i­mental cruise over London, war against Ger­many became a cer­tainty.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor must the threat of sub­mar­ines be for­got­ten in this con­nec­tion.</p>
<p>I am almost ashamed of treat­ing a theme of such import­ance and com­plex­ity in such a slight and inad­equate manner, and I am also aware that I have not said any­thing that is new to you. I only wanted to call your atten­tion to the fact that the factor of man’s con­trol over nature, from which he obtains his weapons for his struggle with his fellow-men, must of neces­sity also affect his eco­nomic arrange­ments. We seem to have trav­elled a long way from the prob­lems of a <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, but we shall soon come back to the point. The strength of Marx­ism obvi­ously does not lie in its view of his­tory or in the proph­ecies about the future which it bases upon that view, but in its clear insight into the determ­in­ing influ­ence which is exer­ted by the eco­nomic con­di­tions of man upon his intel­lec­tual, eth­ical and artistic reac­tions. A whole col­lec­tion of cor­rel­a­tions and causal sequences were thus dis­covered, which had hitherto been almost com­pletely dis­reg­arded. But it cannot be assumed that eco­nomic motives are the only ones which determ­ine the beha­viour of men in soci­ety. The unques­tion­able fact that dif­fer­ent indi­vidu­als, races and nations behave dif­fer­ently under the same eco­nomic con­di­tions, in itself proves that the eco­nomic factor cannot be the sole determ­in­ant. It is quite impossible to under­stand how psy­cho­lo­gical factors can be over­looked where the reac­tions of living human beings are involved; for not only were such factors already con­cerned in the estab­lish­ment of these eco­nomic con­di­tions, but, even in obey­ing these con­di­tions, men can do no more than set their ori­ginal instinctual impulses in motion—their self-pre­ser­vat­ive instinct, their love of aggres­sion, their need for love, and their impulse to attain pleas­ure and avoid pain. In an earlier lec­ture we have emphas­ised the import­ance of the part played by the super-ego, which rep­res­ents tra­di­tion and the ideals of the past, and which will resist for some time the pres­sure exer­ted by new eco­nomic situ­ations. And, finally, we must not forget that the mass of man­kind, sub­jec­ted though they are to eco­nomic neces­sit­ies, are borne on by a pro­cess of cul­tural devel­op­ment—some call it civil­isa­tion—which is no doubt influ­enced by all the other factors, but is equally cer­tainly inde­pend­ent of them in its origin; it is com­par­able to an organic pro­cess, and is quite cap­able of itself having an effect upon the other factors. It dis­places the aims of the instincts, and causes men to rebel against what has hitherto been tol­er­able; and, moreover, the pro­gress­ive strength­en­ing of the sci­entific spirit seems to be an essen­tial part of it. If any one were in a pos­i­tion to show in detail how these dif­fer­ent factors—the gen­eral human instinctual dis­pos­i­tion, its racial vari­ations, and its cul­tural modi­fic­a­tions—behave under the influ­ence of vary­ing social organ­isa­tion, pro­fes­sional activ­it­ies and meth­ods of sub­sist­ence, how these factors inhibit or aid one another—if, I say, any one could show this, then he would not only have improved Marx­ism but would have made it into a true social sci­ence. For soci­ology, which deals with the beha­viour of man in soci­ety, can be noth­ing other than applied psy­cho­logy. Strictly speak­ing, indeed, there are only two sci­ences—psy­cho­logy, pure and applied, and nat­ural sci­ence.</p>
<p>When at last the far-reach­ing import­ance of eco­nomic con­di­tions began to be real­ised, the tempta­tion arose to bring about an alter­a­tion in them by means of revolu­tion­ary inter­fer­ence, instead of leav­ing the change to the course of his­tor­ical devel­op­ment. The­or­et­ical Marx­ism, as put into effect in Rus­sian Bolshev­ism, has acquired the energy, the com­pre­hens­ive­ness and the exclus­ive­ness of a <em>Weltan­schauung</em>, but at the same time it has acquired an almost uncanny resemb­lance to what it is oppos­ing. Ori­gin­ally it was itself a part of sci­ence, and, in its real­isa­tion, was built up on sci­ence and tech­no­logy, but it has nev­er­the­less estab­lished a ban upon thought, which is as inex­or­able as was formerly that of reli­gion. All crit­ical exam­in­a­tion of the Marx­ist theory is for­bid­den; doubts of its valid­ity are as vin­dict­ively pun­ished as heresy once was by the Cath­olic Church. The works of Marx, as the source of rev­el­a­tion, have taken the place of the Bible and the Koran, although they are no freer from con­tra­dic­tions and obscur­it­ies than these earlier holy books.</p>
<p>And although prac­tical Marx­ism has remorse­lessly swept away all ideal­istic sys­tems and illu­sions, it has nev­er­the­less developed illu­sions itself, which are no less dubi­ous and unveri­fi­able than their pre­de­cessors. It hopes, in the course of a few gen­er­a­tions, so to alter men that they will be able to live together in the new order of soci­ety almost without fric­tion, and that they will do their work vol­un­tar­ily. In the mean­time it moves else­where the instinctual bar­ri­ers which are essen­tial in any soci­ety, it dir­ects out­wards the aggress­ive tend­en­cies, which threaten every human com­munity, and finds its sup­port in the hos­til­ity of the poor against the rich, and of the hitherto power­less against the former hold­ers of power. But such an alter­a­tion in human nature is very improb­able. The enthu­si­asm with which the mob follow the Bolshev­ist lead at present, so long as the new order is incom­plete and threatened from out­side, gives no guar­an­tee for the future, when it will be fully estab­lished and no longer in danger. In exactly the same way as reli­gion, Bolshev­ism is obliged to com­pensate its believ­ers for the suf­fer­ings and depriva­tions of the present life, by prom­ising them a better life here­after, in which there will be no unsat­is­fied needs. It is true that this para­dise is to be in this world; it will be estab­lished on earth, and will be inaug­ur­ated within a meas­ur­able time. But let us remem­ber that the Jews, whose reli­gion knows noth­ing of a life beyond the grave, also expec­ted the coming of the Mes­siah here on earth, and that the Chris­tian Middle Ages con­stantly believed that the King­dom of God was at hand.</p>
<p>There is no doubt what the answer of Bolshev­ism to these cri­ti­cisms will be. ‘Until men have changed their nature,’ it will say, ‘one must employ the meth­ods which are effect­ive with them to-day. One cannot do without com­pul­sion in their edu­ca­tion or a ban upon think­ing or the applic­a­tion of force even to the spill­ing of blood; and if one did not awake in them the illu­sions you speak of, one would not be able to bring them to submit to this com­pul­sion.’ And it might politely ask us to say how else it could be done. At this point we should be defeated. I should know of no advice to give. I should admit that the con­di­tions of this exper­i­ment would have restrained me, and people like me, from under­tak­ing it; but we are not the only ones con­cerned. There are also men of action, unshak­able in their con­vic­tions, imper­vi­ous to doubt, and insens­it­ive to the suf­fer­ings of any one who stands between them and their goal. It is owing to such men that the tre­mend­ous attempt to insti­tute a new order of soci­ety of this kind is actu­ally being car­ried out in Russia now. At a time when great nations are declar­ing that they expect to find their sal­va­tion solely from a stead­fast adher­ence to Chris­tian piety, the upheaval in Russia—in spite of all its dis­tress­ing fea­tures—seems to bring a prom­ise of a better future. Unfor­tu­nately, neither our own mis­giv­ings nor the fan­at­ical belief of the other side give us any hint of how the exper­i­ment will turn out. The future will teach us. Per­haps it will show that the attempt has been made pre­ma­turely and that a fun­da­mental alter­a­tion of the social order will have little hope of suc­cess until new dis­cov­er­ies are made that will increase our con­trol over the forces of nature, and so make easier the sat­is­fac­tion of our needs. It may be that only then will it be pos­sible for a new order of soci­ety to emerge which will not only banish the mater­ial want of the masses, but at the same time meet the cul­tural require­ments of indi­vidual men. But even so we shall still have to struggle for an indef­in­ite length of time with the dif­fi­culties which the intract­able nature of man puts in the way of every kind of social com­munity.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gen­tle­men—Let me in con­clu­sion sum up what I had to say about the rela­tion of psycho-ana­lysis to the ques­tion of a <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. Psycho-ana­lysis is not, in my opin­ion, in a pos­i­tion to create a <em>Welftan­schauung</em> of its own. It has no need to do so, for it is a branch of sci­ence, and can sub­scribe to the sci­entific <em>Weltan­schauung</em>. The latter, how­ever, hardly merits such a high-sound­ing name, for it does not take everything into its scope, it is incom­plete, and it makes no claim to being com­pre­hens­ive or to con­sti­tut­ing a system. Sci­entific thought is still in its infancy; there are very many of the great prob­lems with which it has as yet been unable to cope. A <em>Weltan­schauung</em> based upon sci­ence has, apart from the emphasis it lays upon the real world, essen­tially neg­at­ive char­ac­ter­ist­ics, such as that it limits itself to truth, and rejects illu­sions. Those of our fellow-men who are dis­sat­is­fied with this state of things and who desire some­thing more for their moment­ary peace of mind may look for it where they can find it. We shall not blame them for doing so; but we cannot help them and cannot change our own way of think­ing on their account.</p>
